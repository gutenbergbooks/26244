<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My Dear Mr. Garland</span>:&mdash;You have been kind
enough to let me see the proofs of <i>Cavanagh: Forest Ranger</i>.
I have read it with mingled feelings&mdash;with keen appreciation
of your sympathetic understanding of the problems
which confronted the Forest Service before the Western
people understood it, and with deep regret that I am no
longer officially associated with its work (although I am
as deeply interested, and almost as closely in touch as
ever).</p>
<p>The Western frontier, to the lasting sorrow of all old
hunters like yourself, has now practically disappeared.
Its people faced life with a manly dependence on their
own courage and capacity which did them, and still does
them, high honor. Some of them were naturally slow
to see the advantages of the new order. But now that they
have seen it, there is nowhere more intelligent, convinced,
and effective support of the Conservation policies than
in the West. The establishment of the new order in
some places was not child&#8217;s play. But there is a strain of
fairness among the Western people which you can always
count on in such a fight as the Forest Service has made
and won.</p>
<p>The Service contains the best body of young men I
know, and many splendid veterans. It is nine-tenths
made up of Western men. It has met the West on its
own ground, and it has won the contest&mdash;an episode of
which you have so well described&mdash;because the West believes
in what it stands for.</p>
<p>I have lived much among the Western mountain men.
I have studied their problems; differed with some of them,
and worked with many of them. Sometimes I have lost
and sometimes I have won, but every time the fight was
worth while. I have come out of it all with a respect and
liking for the West which will last as long as I do.</p>

<h3>THE DESERT CHARIOT</h3>
</div>

<p>Lee Virginia Wetherford began her return journey
into the mountain West with exultation. From the
moment she opened her car-window that August morning
in Nebraska the plain called to her, sustained her
illusions. It was all quite as big, as tawny, as she remembered
it&mdash;fit arena for the epic deeds in which her
father had been a leader bold and free.</p>
<p>Her memories of Roaring Fork and its people were
childish and romantic. She recalled, vividly, the stagecoach
which used to amble sedately, not to say wheezily,
from the railway to the Fork and from the Fork back
to the railway, in the days when she had ridden away in
it a tearful, despairing, long-limbed girl, and fully expected
to find it waiting for her at Sulphur City, with old
Tom Quentan still as its driver.</p>
<p>The years of absence had been years of growth, and
though she had changed from child to woman in these
suns and moons, she could not think of the Fork as anything
other than the romantic town she had left&mdash;a list
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
wherein spurred and steel-girt cow-men strode lamely
over uneven sidewalks, or swooped, like the red nomads
of the desert, in mad troops through the starlit night.</p>
<p>The first hint of &#8220;the new West&#8221; came to her by way
of the pretentious Hotel Alma, which stood opposite the
station at Sulphur, and to which she was led by a colored
porter of most elaborate and kindly manners.</p>
<p>This house, which furnished an excellent dinner and
an absorbing mixture of types both American and
European, was vaguely disturbing to her. It was plainly
not of the old-time West&mdash;the West her father had
dominated in the days &#8220;before the invasion.&#8221; It was,
indeed, distinctly built for the tourist trade, and was filled
with all that might indicate the comfortable nearness of
big game and good fishing.</p>
<p>Upon inquiry as to the stage, she was amazed to hear
that an automobile now made the journey to the Fork
in five hours, and that it left immediately after the midday
meal.</p>
<p>This was still more disconcerting than the hotel, but
the closer she came to the ride, the more resigned she
became, for she began to relive the long hours of torture
on the trip outward, during which she had endured
clouds of dust and blazing heat. There were some
disadvantages in the old stage, romantic as her conception
of it had been. Furthermore, the coach had
gone; so she made application for her seat at once.</p>
<p>At two o&#8217;clock, as the car came to the door, she entered
it with a sense of having stepped from one invading
chariot of progress to another, so big and shining and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
up to date was its glittering body, shining with brass and
glowing with brave red paint. It was driven, also, by a
small, lean young fellow, whom the cowboys on her
father&#8217;s ranch would have called a &#8220;lunger,&#8221; so thin and
small were his hands and arms. He was quite as far
from old Tom Quentan as the car was from the coach
on which he used to perch.</p>
<p>The owner of the machine, perceiving under Virginia&#8217;s
veil a girl&#8217;s pretty face, motioned her to the seat with the
driver, and rode beside her for a few minutes (standing
on the foot-board), to inquire if she were visiting friends
in the Fork.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied, curtly, &#8220;I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something in her tone discouraged him from further
inquiry, and he soon dropped away.</p>
<p>The seats were apparently quite filled with men,
when at the last moment a middle-aged woman, with
a penetrating, nasal, drawling utterance, inquired if she
were expected to be &#8220;squoze in betwixt them two
strange men on that there back seat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee Virginia turned, and was about to greet the woman
as an old acquaintance when something bold and
vulgar in the complaining vixen&#8217;s face checked the impulse.</p>
<p>The stage-agent called her &#8220;Miss McBride,&#8221; and
with exaggerated courtesy explained that travel was
heavy, and that he had not known that she was intending
to go.</p>
<p>One of the men, a slender young fellow, moved to the
middle of the seat, and politely said, &#8220;You can sit on
the outside, madam.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></p>
<p>She clambered in with doleful clamor. &#8220;Well, I never
rode in one of these pesky things before, and if you git
me safe down to the Fork I&#8217;ll promise never to jump
the brute another time.&#8221;</p>
<p>A chuckle went &#8217;round the car; but it soon died out,
for the new-comer scarcely left off talking for the next
three hours, and Virginia was very glad she had not
claimed acquaintanceship.</p>
<p>As they whirled madly down the valley the girl was
astonished at the transformation in the hot, dry land.
Wire fences ran here and there, enclosing fields of alfalfa
and wheat where once only the sage-brush and the grease-wood
grew. Painted farm-houses shone on the banks
of the creeks, and irrigating ditches flashed across the
road with an air of business and decision.</p>
<p>For the first half-hour it seemed as if the dominion of
the cattle-man had ended, but as the swift car drew away
from the valley of the Bear and climbed the divide toward
the north, the free range was disclosed, with few
changes, save in the cattle, which were all of the harmless
or hornless variety, appearing tame and spiritless
in comparison with the old-time half-wild broad-horn
breeds.</p>
<p>No horsemen were abroad, and nothing was heard but
the whirr of the motor and the steady flow of the garrulous
woman behind. Not till the machine was descending
the long divide to the west did a single cowboy come
into view to remind the girl of the heroic past, and this
one but a symbol&mdash;a figure of speech. Leaning forward
upon his reeling, foaming steed, he spurred along the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
road as if pursued, casting backward apprehensive
glances, as if in the brassy eyes of the car he read his
doom&mdash;the doom of all his kind.</p>
<p>Some vague perception of this symbolism came into
Virginia&#8217;s thought as she watched the swift and tireless
wheels swallow the shortening distance between
the heels of the flying pony and the gilded seat in which
she sat. Vain was the attempt to outride progress. The
rider pulled out, and as they passed him the girl found
still greater significance in the fact that he was one of
her father&#8217;s old-time cowboys&mdash;a grizzled, middle-aged,
light-weight centaur whom she would not have recognized
had not the driver called him by his quaint well-known
nickname.</p>
<p>Soon afterward the motor overhauled and passed the
battered stage lumbering along, bereft of its passengers,
sunk to the level of carrying the baggage for its contemptuous
aristocratic supplanter; and as Lee Virginia
looked up at the driver, she caught the glance of a simple-minded
farm-boy looking down at her. Tom Quentan
no longer guided the plunging, reeling broncos on their
swift and perilous way&mdash;he had sturdily declined to
&#8220;play second fiddle to a kerosene tank.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee began to wonder if she should find the Fork much
changed&mdash;her mother was a bad correspondent.</p>
<p>Her unspoken question, opportunely asked by another,
was answered by Mrs. McBride. &#8220;Oh, Lord, yes! Summer
tourists are crawlin&#8217; all over us sence this otto line
began. &#8217;Pears like all the bare-armed boobies and cross-legged
little rips in Omaha and Denver has jest got to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
ride in and look us over. Two of them new hotels in
Sulphur don&#8217;t do a thing but feed these tenderfeet. I
s&#8217;pose pro-hi-bition will be the next grandstand-play on
the part of our town-lot boomers. We old cow-punchers
don&#8217;t care whether the town grows or not, but these
hyer bankers and truck-farmers are all for raisin&#8217; the
price o&#8217; land and taxin&#8217; us quiet fellers out of our boots.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia winced a little at this, for it flashed over her
that all the women with whom she had grown up spoke
very much in this fashion&mdash;using breeding terms almost
as freely as the ranchers themselves. It was natural
enough. What else could they do in talking to men who
knew nothing but cows? And yet it was no longer
wholly excusable even to the men, who laughed openly
in reply.</p>
<p>The mountains, too, yielded their disappointment.
For the first hour or two they seemed lower and less
mysterious than of old. They neither wooed nor
threatened&mdash;only the plain remained as vast and as
majestic as ever. The fences, the occasional farms in the
valleys could not subdue its outspread, serene majesty
to prettiness. It was still of desert sternness and breadth.</p>
<p>From all these impersonal considerations the girl was
brought back to the vital phases of her life by the harsh
voice of one of the men. &#8220;Lize Wetherford is goin&#8217;
to get jumped one o&#8217; these days for sellin&#8217; whiskey without
a license. I&#8217;ve told her so, too. Everybody knows
she&#8217;s a-doin&#8217; it, and what beats me is her goin&#8217; along in
that way when a little time and money would set her
straight with the law.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></p>
<p>The shock of all this lay in the fact that Eliza Wetherford
was the mother to whom Lee Virginia was returning
after ten years of life in the East, and the significance of
the man&#8217;s words froze her blood for an instant. There
was an accent of blunt truth in his voice, and the mere
fact that a charge of such weight could be openly made
appalled the girl, although her recollections of her mother
were not entirely pleasant.</p>
<p>The young fellow on the back seat slowly said: &#8220;I
don&#8217;t complain of Lize sellin&#8217; bad whiskey, but the grub
she sets up is fierce.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The grub ain&#8217;t so bad; it&#8217;s the way she stacks it up,&#8221;
remarked another. &#8220;But, then, these little fly-bit cow-towns
are all alike and all bad, so far as hotels are
concerned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee Virginia, crimson and burning hot, was in agony
lest they should go further in their criticism.</p>
<p>She knew that her mother kept a boarding-house;
and while she was not proud of it, there was nothing
precisely disgraceful in it&mdash;many widowed women found
it the last resort; but this brutal comment on the way in
which her business was carried on was like a slash of mud
in the face. Her joy in the ride, her impersonal exultant
admiration of the mountains was gone, and with flaming
cheeks and beating heart she sat, tense and bent, dreading
some new and keener thrust.</p>
<p>Happily the conversation turned aside and fell upon
the Government&#8217;s forest policy, and Sam Gregg, a squat,
wide-mouthed, harsh-voiced individual, cursed the action
of Ross Cavanagh the ranger in the district above the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
Fork. &#8220;He thinks he&#8217;s Secretary of War, but I reckon
he won&#8217;t after I interview him. He can&#8217;t shuffle my
sheep around over the hills at his own sweet will.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young fellow on the back seat quietly interposed.
&#8220;You want to be sure you&#8217;ve got the cinch on Cavanagh
good and square, Sam, or he&#8217;ll be a-ridin&#8217; <i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He certainly is an arbitrary cuss,&#8221; said the old woman.
&#8220;They say he was one of Teddy&#8217;s Rough-riders in
the war. He sure can ride and handle a gun. &#8217;Pears
like he thinks he&#8217;s runnin&#8217; the whole range,&#8221; she continued,
after a pause. &#8220;Cain&#8217;t nobody so much as shoot
a grouse since he came on, and the Supervisor upholds
him in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee Virginia wondered about all this supervision, for
it was new to her.</p>
<p>Gregg, the sheepman, went on: &#8220;As I tell Redfield,
I don&#8217;t object to the forest policy&mdash;it&#8217;s a good thing
for me; I get my sheep pastured cheaper than I could
do any other way, but it makes me hot to have grazing
lines run on me and my herders jacked up every time
they get over the line. Ross run one bunch off the
reservation last Friday. I&#8217;m going to find out about
that. He&#8217;ll learn he can&#8217;t get &#8216;arbitrary&#8217; with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee Virginia, glancing back at this man, felt sorry
for any one who opposed him, for she recalled him as
one of the fiercest of the cattle-men&mdash;one ever ready to
cut a farmer&#8217;s fence or burn a sheep-herder&#8217;s wagon.</p>
<p>The old woman chuckled: &#8220;&#8217;Pears like you&#8217;ve changed
your tune since &#8217;98, Sam.&#8221;</p>
<p>He admitted his conversion shamelessly. &#8220;I&#8217;m for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
whatever will pay best. Just now, with a high tariff,
sheep are the boys. So long as I can get on the reserve
at seven cents a head&mdash;lambs free&mdash;I&#8217;m going to put
every dollar I&#8217;ve got into sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to get thrown off altogether one of
these days,&#8221; said the young man on the back seat.</p>
<p>Thereupon a violent discussion arose over the question
of the right of a sheepman to claim first grass for his
flocks, and Gregg boasted that he cared nothing for &#8220;the
dead-line.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ll throw my sheep where I please,&#8221; he
declared. &#8220;They&#8217;ve tried to run me out of Deer
Creek, but I&#8217;m there to stay. I have ten thousand more
on the way, and the man that tries to stop me will find
trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>The car was descending into the valley of the Roaring
Fork now, and wire fences and alfalfa fields on either
side gave further evidence of the change in the land&#8217;s
dominion. New houses of frame and old houses in fresh
paint shone vividly from the green of the willows and
cottonwoods. A ball-ground on the outskirts of the village
was another guarantee of progress. The cowboy
was no longer the undisputed prince of the country fair.</p>
<p>Down past the court-house, refurbished and deeper
sunk in trees, Lee Virginia rode, recalling the wild night
when three hundred armed and vengeful cowboys
surrounded it, holding three cattle-barons and their
hired invaders against all comers, resolute to be their
own judge, jury, and hangman. It was all as peaceful as
a Sunday afternoon at this moment, with no sign of the
fierce passions of the past.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>There were new store-buildings and cement walks
along the main street of the town, and here and there a
real lawn, cut by a lawn-mower; but as the machine
buzzed on toward the river the familiar little old battlemented
buildings came to view. The Palace Hotel,
half log, half battlement, remained on its perilous site
beside the river. The triangle where the trails met still
held Halsey&#8217;s Three Forks Saloon, and next to it stood
Markheit&#8217;s general store, from which the cowboys and
citizens had armed themselves during the ten days&#8217; war
of cattle-men and rustlers.</p>
<p>The car crossed the Roaring Fork and drew up before
two small shacks, one of which bore a faded sign, &#8220;The
Wetherford House,&#8221; and the other in fresher paint, &#8220;The
Wetherford Café.&#8221; On the sidewalk a group of Indians
were sitting, and a half-dozen slouching white men stood
waiting at the door.</p>
<p>At sight of her mother&#8217;s hotel Virginia forgot every
other building, every other object, and when the driver
asked, respectfully, &#8220;Where will you want to get off,
miss?&#8221; she did not reply, but rose unsteadily in her seat,
blindly reaching for her bag and her wraps. Her slim,
gray-robed figure, graceful even in her dismay, appealed
to every onlooker, but Gregg was the one to offer a hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Allow me, miss,&#8221; he said, with the smile of a wolf.</p>
<p>Declining his aid, she took her bag from the driver and
walked briskly up the street as if she were a resident and
knew precisely where she wanted to go. &#8220;One o&#8217; those
Eastern tourists, I reckon?&#8221; she heard the old woman
say.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>As she went past the hotel-porch her heart beat hard
and her breath shortened. In a flash she divined the
truth. She understood why her mother had discouraged
her coming home. It was not merely on account of the
money&mdash;it was because she knew that her business was
wrong.</p>
<p>What a squalid little den it was! How cheap, bald,
and petty the whole town seemed of a sudden. Lee
Virginia halted and turned. There was only one thing
to be done, and that was to make herself known. She
retraced her steps, pulled open the broken screen door,
and entered the café. It was a low, dingy dining-room
filled with the odor of ham and bad coffee. At the tables
ten or fifteen men, a motley throng, were busily feeding
their voracious jaws, and on her left, behind a showcase
filled with cigars, stood her mother, looking old,
unkempt, and worried. The changes in her were so
great that the girl stood in shocked alarm. At last she
raised her veil. &#8220;Mother,&#8221; she said, &#8220;don&#8217;t you know
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>A look of surprise went over the older woman&#8217;s flabby
face&mdash;a glow which brought back something of her other
self, as she cried: &#8220;Why, Lee Virginny, where did you
come from?&#8221;</p>
<p>The boarders stopped chewing and stared in absorbed
interest, while Virginia kissed her blowsy mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the Lord, it&#8217;s little Virginny!&#8221; said one old fellow.
&#8220;It&#8217;s her daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon this a mutter of astonishment arose, and the
waiter-girls, giggling, marvelling, and envious, paused,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
their platters in hand, to exchange comment on the new-comer&#8217;s
hat and gown. A cowboy at the washing-sink
in the corner suspended his face-polishing and gaped
over his shoulder in silent ecstasy.</p>
<p>For a full minute, so it seemed, this singular, interesting,
absorbed immobility lasted; then a seedy little man
rose, and approached the girl. His manner was grotesquely
graceful as he said: &#8220;We are all glad to greet
you home again, Miss Virginia.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave her hand hesitatingly. &#8220;It&#8217;s Mr. Sifton,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; he replied; &#8220;the same old ha&#8217;penny, only a
little more worn&mdash;worn, not polished,&#8221; he added, with
a smile.</p>
<p>She remembered him then&mdash;an Englishman, a remittance
man, a &#8220;lord,&#8221; they used to say. His eyes were
kind, and his mouth, despite its unshaved stubble of
beard, was refined. A harmless little man&mdash;his own
worst enemy, as the saying goes.</p>
<p>Thereupon others of the men came forward to greet
her, and though she had some difficulty in recognizing
one or two of them (so hardly had the years of her
absence used them), she eventually succeeded in placing
them all.</p>
<p>At length her mother led her through the archway
which connected the two shanties, thence along a narrow
hall into a small bedroom, into which the western sunset
fell. It was a shabby place, but as a refuge from
the crowd in the restaurant it was grateful.</p>
<p>Lize looked at her daughter critically. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
what I&#8217;m going to do with a girl like you.&mdash;Why, you&#8217;re
purty&mdash;purty as a picture. You were skinny as a child&mdash;I&#8217;m
fair dazed. Great snakes, how you have opened
out!&mdash;You&#8217;re the living image of your dad.&mdash;What
started you back? I told you to stay where you
was.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl stared at her helplessly, trying to understand
herself and her surroundings. There was, in truth,
something singularly alien in her mother&#8217;s attitude. She
seemed on the defensive, not wishing to be too closely
studied. &#8220;Her manner is not even affectionate&mdash;only
friendly. It is as if I were only an embarrassing visitor,&#8221;
the girl thought. Aloud she said: &#8220;I had no place to
go after Aunt Celia died. I had to come home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wrote they was willing to keep you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They were, but I couldn&#8217;t ask it of them. I had
no right to burden them, and, besides, Mrs. Hall wrote
me that you were sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am; but I didn&#8217;t want you to come back. Lay off
your things and come out to supper. We&#8217;ll talk afterward.&#8221;</p>
<p>The eating-house, the rooms and hallways, were all
of that desolate shabbiness which comes from shiftlessness
joined with poverty. The carpets were frayed and
stained with tobacco-juice, and the dusty windows were
littered with dead flies. The curtains were ragged, the
paper peeling from the walls, and the plastering cracked
into unsightly lines. Everything on which the girl&#8217;s
eyes fell contrasted strongly with her aunt&#8217;s home on
the Brandywine&mdash;not because that house was large or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
luxurious, but because it was exquisitely in order, and
sweet with flowers and dainty arrangement of color.</p>
<p>She understood now the final warnings uttered by her
friends. &#8220;You will find everything changed,&#8221; they had
said, &#8220;because you are changed.&#8221;</p>
<p>She regretted bitterly that she had ever left her
Eastern friends. Her mother, in truth, showed little
pleasure at her coming, and almost nothing of the illness
of which a neighbor had written. It was, indeed,
this letter which had decided her to return to the West.
She had come, led by a sense of duty, not by affection,
for she had never loved her mother as a daughter should&mdash;they
were in some way antipathetic&mdash;and now she
found herself an unwelcome guest.</p>
<p>Then, too, the West had called to her: the West of her
childhood, the romantic, chivalrous West, the West of
the miner, the cattle-man, the wolf, and the eagle. She
had returned, led by a poetic sentiment, and here now
she sat realizing as if by a flash of inward light that the
West she had known as a child had passed, had suddenly
grown old and commonplace&mdash;in truth, it had never
existed at all!</p>
<p>One of the waitresses, whose elaborately puffed and
waved hair set forth her senseless vanity, called from the
door: &#8220;You can come out now, your ma says! Your
supper&#8217;s ready!&#8221;</p>
<p>With aching head and shaking knees Virginia reentered
the dining-room, which was now nearly empty
of its &#8220;guests,&#8221; but was still misty with the steam of
food, and swarming with flies. These pests buzzed like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
bees around the soiled places on the table-cloths, and one
of her mother&#8217;s first remarks was a fretful apology regarding
her trials with those insects. &#8220;Seems like you
can&#8217;t keep &#8217;em out,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Lee Virginia presented the appearance of some &#8220;settlement
worker,&#8221; some fair lady on a visit to the poor, as
she took her seat at the table and gingerly opened the
small moist napkin which the waiter dropped before her.
Her appetite was gone. Her appetite failed at the very
sight of the fried eggs and hot and sputtering bacon, and
she turned hastily to her coffee. A fly was in that! She
uttered a little choking cry, and buried her face in her
handkerchief and sobbed.</p>
<p>Lize turned upon the waitress and lashed her with
stinging phrases. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you serve things better than
this? Take that cup away! My God, you make me
tired&mdash;fumblin&#8217; around here with your eyes on the men!
Pay more attention to your work and less to your crimps,
and you&#8217;ll please me a whole lot better!&#8221;</p>
<p>With desperate effort Lee conquered her disgust.
&#8220;Never mind, I&#8217;m tired and a little upset. I don&#8217;t need
any dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The slob will go, just the same. I&#8217;ve put up with
her because help is scarce, but here&#8217;s where she gits off!&#8221;</p>
<p>In this moment Virginia perceived that her mother was
of the same nature with Mrs. McBride&mdash;not one whit
more refined&mdash;and the gulf between them swiftly widened.
Hastily sipping her coffee, she tried hard to keep back
the tears, but failed; and no sooner did her mother turn
away than she fled to her room, there to sob unrestrainedly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
her despair and shame. &#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t stand it,&#8221; she
called. &#8220;I can&#8217;t! I can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>Outside, the mountains deepened in splendor, growing
each moment more mysterious and beautiful under the
sunset sky, but the girl derived no comfort from them.
Her loneliness and her perplexities had closed her eyes
to their majestic drama. She felt herself alien and
solitary in the land of her birth.</p>
<p>Lize came in half an hour later, pathetic in her attempt
at &#8220;slicking up.&#8221; She was still handsome in a large-featured
way, but her gray hair was there, and her face
laid with a network of fretful lines. Her color was
bad. At the moment her cheeks were yellow and
sunken.</p>
<p>She complained of being short of breath and lame
and tired. &#8220;I&#8217;m always tired,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;&#8217;Pears
like sometimes I can&#8217;t scarcely drag myself around, but
I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>A pang of comprehending pain shot through Virginia&#8217;s
heart. If she could not love, she could at least
pity and help; and reaching forth her hand, she patted
her mother on the knee. &#8220;Poor old mammy!&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lize was touched by this action of her proud daughter,
and smiled sadly. &#8220;This is no place for you. It&#8217;s
nothin&#8217; but a measly little old cow-town gone to seed&mdash;and
I&#8217;m gone to seed with it. I know it. But what is a
feller to do? I&#8217;m stuck here, and I&#8217;ve got to make a
living or quit. I can&#8217;t quit. I ain&#8217;t got the grit to eat
a dose, and so I stagger along.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come back to help you, mother. You must let
me relieve you of some of the burden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What can you do, child?&#8221; Lize asked, gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can teach.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in this town you can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s a terrible prejudice against&mdash;well,
against me. And, besides, the places are all filled for
the next year. The Wetherfords ain&#8217;t among the first
circles any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>This daunted the girl more than she could express,
but she bravely made advance. &#8220;But there must be
other schools in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are&mdash;a few. But I reckon you better pull out
and go back, at least, to Sulphur; they don&#8217;t know so
much about me there, and, besides, they&#8217;re a little more
like your kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee Virginia remembered Gregg&#8217;s charge against her
mother. &#8220;What do you mean by the prejudice against
you?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>Lize was evasive. &#8220;Since I took to running this
restaurant my old friends kind o&#8217; fell off&mdash;but never
mind that to-night. Tell me about things back East.
I don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose I&#8217;ll ever get as far as Omaha again; I used
to go with Ed every time I felt like it. He was good to
me, your father. If ever there was a prince of a man,
Ed Wetherford was him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s thought was now turned into other half-forgotten
channels. &#8220;I wish you would tell me more
about father. I don&#8217;t remember where he was buried.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Neither do I, child&mdash;I mean I don&#8217;t know exactly.
You see, after that cattle-war, he went away to Texas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember, but it&#8217;s all very dim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he never came back and never wrote, and by-and-by
word came that he had died and was buried;
but I never could go down to see where his grave was at.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you know the name of the town?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but it was a new place away down in the Pan
Handle, and nobody I knew lived there. And I never
knew anything more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee sighed hopelessly. &#8220;I hate to think of him lying
neglected down there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Pears like the whole world we lived in in them days
has slipped off the map,&#8221; replied the older woman; and
as the room was darkening, she rose and lighted a dusty
electric globe which dangled from the ceiling over the
small table. &#8220;Well, I must go back into the restaurant;
I hain&#8217;t got a girl I can trust to count the cash.&#8221;</p>
<p>Left alone, Lee Virginia wept no more, but her face
settled into an expression of stern sadness. It seemed
as if her girlhood had died out of her, and that she was
about to begin the same struggle with work and worry
which had marked the lives of all the women she had
known in her childhood.</p>
<p>Out on the porch a raw youth was playing wailing
tunes on a mouth-organ, and in the &#8220;parlor&#8221; a man
was uttering silly jokes to a tittering girl. The smell of
cheap cigars filled the hallway and penetrated to her
nostrils. Every sight and sound sickened her. &#8220;Can
it be that the old town, the town of my childhood, was of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
this character&mdash;so sordid, so vulgar?&#8221; she asked herself.
&#8220;And mother&mdash;what is the matter with her? She is
not even glad to see me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Weary with her perplexities, she fastened her door
at last, and went to bed, hoping to end&mdash;for a few hours,
at least&mdash;the ache in her heart and the benumbing whirl
of her thought.</p>
<p>But this respite was denied her. Almost at once she
began to fancy that a multitudinous minute creeping
and stirring was going on about her&mdash;in her hair, over
her neck, across her feet. For a time she explained this
by reference to her disordered nerves, but at last some
realization of the truth came to her, and she sprang out
upon the floor in horror and disgust. Lighting the lamp,
she turned to scrutinize her couch. It swarmed with
vermin. The ceiling was spattered with them. They
raced across the walls in platoons, thin and voracious as
wolves.</p>
<p>With a choking, angry, despairing moan she snatched
her clothing from the chair and stood at bay. It needed
but this touch to complete her disillusionment.</p>

<h2>II</h2>
<h3>THE FOREST RANGER</h3>
</div>

<p>From her makeshift bed in the middle of the floor
Lee Virginia was awakened next morning by the passing
of some one down the hall calling at each door, &#8220;Six
o&#8217;clock!&#8221; She had not slept at all till after one.
She was lame, heart-weary, and dismayed, but she rose
and dressed herself as neatly as before. She had decided
to return to Sulphur. &#8220;I cannot endure this,&#8221;
she had repeated to herself a hundred times. &#8220;I <i>will</i>
not!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hearing the clatter of dishes, she ventured (with
desperate courage) into the dining-room, which was
again filled with cowboys, coal-miners, ranchers and
their tousled families, and certain nondescript town
loafers of tramp-like appearance. The flies were nearly
as bad as ever&mdash;but not quite, for under Mrs. Wetherford&#8217;s
dragooning the waiters had made a nerveless
assault upon them with newspaper bludgeons, and a few
of them had been driven out into the street.</p>
<p>Slipping into a seat at the end of the table which
offered the cleanest cloth, Lee Virginia glanced round
upon her neighbors with shrinking eyes. All were shovelling
their food with knife-blades and guzzling their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
coffee with bent heads; their faces scared her, and she
dropped her eyes.</p>
<p>At her left, however, sat two men whose greetings were
frank and manly, and whose table-manners betrayed a
higher form of life. One of them was a tall man with a
lean red face against which his blond mustache lay
like a chalk-mark. He wore a corduroy jacket, cut in
Norfolk style, and in the collar of his yellow shirt a green
tie was loosely knotted. His hands were long and
freckled, but were manifestly trained to polite usages.</p>
<p>The other man was younger and browner, and of a
compact, athletic figure. On the breast of his olive-green
coat hung a silver badge which bore a pine-tree
in the centre. His shirt was tan-colored and rough, but
his head was handsome. He looked like a young officer
in the undress uniform of the regular army. His
hands were strong but rather small, and the lines of his
shoulders graceful. Most attractive of all were his eyes,
so brown, so quietly humorous, and so keen.</p>
<p>In the rumble of cheap and vulgar talk the voices of
these men appealed to the troubled girl with great charm.
She felt more akin to them than to any one else in the
room, and from time to time she raised her eyes to their
faces.</p>
<p>They were aware of her also, and their gaze was
frankly admiring as well as wondering; and in passing
the ham and eggs or the sugar they contrived to show
her that they considered her a lady in a rough place, and
that they would like to know more about her.</p>
<p>She accepted their civilities with gratitude, and listened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
to their talk with growing interest. It seemed that the
young man had come down from the hills to meet his
friend and take him back to his cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do it to-day, Ross,&#8221; said the older man. &#8220;I
wish I could, but one meal of this kind is all I can stand
these days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re getting finicky,&#8221; laughed the younger man.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting old. Time was when my fell of hair
would rise at nothing, not even flies in the butter, but
now&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That last visit to the ancestral acres is what did it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s age&mdash;age and prosperity. I know now what
it is to have broiled steak.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wetherford, seizing the moment, came down
to do the honors. &#8220;You fellers ought to know my girl.
Virginny, this is Forest Supervisor Redfield, and this is
Ross Cavanagh, his forest ranger in this district. You
ought to know each other. My girl&#8217;s just back from
school, and she don&#8217;t think much of the Fork. It&#8217;s a
little too coarse for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee flushed under this introduction, and her distress
was so evident that both men came to her rescue.</p>
<p>The older man bowed, and said: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you
had a daughter, Mrs. Wetherford,&#8221; and Cavanagh,
with a glance of admiration, added: &#8220;We&#8217;ve been wondering
who you might be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lize went on: &#8220;I thought I&#8217;d got rid of her.
She&#8217;s been away now for about ten years. I don&#8217;t
know but it was a mistake&mdash;look&#8217;s like she&#8217;s grown a
little too fine-haired for us doughies out here.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So much the worse for us,&#8221; replied Redfield.</p>
<p>This little dialogue gave the girl time to recover herself,
but as Cavanagh watched the blush fade from her face,
leaving it cold and white, he sympathized with her&mdash;pitied
her from the bottom of his heart. He perceived that
he was a chance spectator of the first scene in a painful
domestic drama&mdash;one that might easily become a tragedy.
He wondered what the forces might be which had brought
such a daughter to this sloven, this virago. To see a maid
of this delicate bloom thrust into such a place as Lize
Wetherford&#8217;s &#8220;hotel&#8221; had the reputation of being
roused indignation.</p>
<p>&#8220;When did you reach town?&#8221; he asked, and into his
voice his admiration crept.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You find great changes here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so great as in my mother. It&#8217;s all&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She
stopped abruptly, and he understood.</p>
<p>Lize being drawn back to her cash-register, Redfield
turned to say: &#8220;My dear young lady, I don&#8217;t suppose you
remember me, but I knew you when you were a tot of
five or six. I knew your father very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you?&#8221; Her face lighted up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, poor fellow, he went away from here rather
under a cloud, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember a little of it. I was here when the
shooting took place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you were. Well, since then much has happened
to us all,&#8221; he explained to the ranger. &#8220;There wasn&#8217;t
room for a dashing young blood such as Ed Wetherford
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
was in those days.&#8221; He turned to Lee. &#8220;He was no
worse than the men on the other side&mdash;it was dog eat
dog; but some way the people rather settled on him as
a scapegoat. He was forced out, and your mother has
borne the brunt of it since. Those were lawless days.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a painful subject, and Redfield&#8217;s voice grew
lower and more hesitant as he went on. Looking at
this charming girl through the smoke of fried ham, with
obscene insects buzzing about her fair head, made him
feel for the thousandth time, and more keenly than ever
before, the amazing combinations in American society.
How could she be the issue of Edward and Eliza Wetherford?</p>
<p>More and more Lee Virginia&#8217;s heart went out in trust
toward these two men. Opposed to the malodorous,
unshaven throng which filled the room, they seemed
wondrously softened and sympathetic, and in the ranger&#8217;s
gaze was something else&mdash;something which made
her troubles somehow less intolerable. She felt that he
understood the difficult situation in which she found
herself.</p>
<p>Redfield went on. &#8220;You find us horribly uncivilized
after ten years&#8217; absence?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I find <i>this</i> uncivilised,&#8221; she replied, with fierce intensity,
looking around the room. Then, on the impulse,
she added: &#8220;I can&#8217;t stand it! I came here to live with
my mother, but this is too&mdash;too horrible!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand your repulsion,&#8221; replied Redfield. &#8220;A
thousand times I repeat, apropos of this country, &#8216;Where
every prospect pleases and only man is vile.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you suppose it was as bad ten years ago?&#8221; she
asked. &#8220;Was everything as dirty&mdash;as mean? Were the
houses then as full of flies and smells?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid they were. Of course, the country isn&#8217;t
all like this, and there are neat homes and gentle people
in Sulphur; but most cattle-men are&mdash;as they&#8217;ve always
been&mdash;a shiftless, happy-go-lucky lot at best&mdash;and some
of them have been worse, as you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never dreamed of finding my mother in such a
place,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to do or say.
She isn&#8217;t well. I ought to stay and help her, and yet&mdash;oh,
it is disheartening!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lize tapped Redfield on the shoulder. &#8220;Come over
here, Reddy, if you&#8217;ve finished your breakfast; I want
to talk with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Redfield rose and followed his landlady behind the
counter, and there sat in earnest conversation while she
made change. The tone in which her mother addressed
the Supervisor, her action of touching him as one man
lays hand upon another, was profoundly revealing to
Lee Virginia. She revolted from it without realizing
exactly what it meant; and feeling deeply but vaguely
the forest ranger&#8217;s sympathy, she asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;How <i>can</i> you endure this kind of life?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t, and I don&#8217;t,&#8221; he answered, cautiously, for
they were being closely observed. &#8220;I am seldom in
town; my dominion is more than a mile above this
level. My cabin is nine thousand feet above the sea.
It is clean and quiet up there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are all the other restaurants in the village like this?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Worse. I come here because it is the best.&#8221;</p>
<p>She rose. &#8220;I can&#8217;t stand this air and these flies any
longer. They&#8217;re too disgusting.&#8221;</p>
<p>He followed her into the other house, conscious of the
dismay and bitterness which burst forth the instant they
were alone. &#8220;What am I to do? She is my mother,
but I&#8217;ve lost all sense of relationship to her. And these
people&mdash;except you and Mr. Redfield&mdash;are all disgusting
to me. It isn&#8217;t because my mother is poor, it isn&#8217;t because
she&#8217;s keeping boarders; it&#8217;s something else.&#8221; At
this point her voice failed her.</p>
<p>The ranger, deeply moved, stood helplessly silent.
What could he say? He knew a great deal better than
she the essential depravity of her mother, and he felt
keenly the cruelty of fate which had plunged a fine
young spirit into this swamp of ill-smelling humanity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us go out into the air,&#8221; he suggested, presently.
&#8220;The mountain wind will do you good.&#8221;</p>
<p>She followed him trustfully, and as she stepped from
the squalor of the hotel into the splendor of the morning
her head lifted. She drank the clear, crisp wind as one
takes water in the desert.</p>
<p>&#8220;The air is clean, anyway,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Cavanagh, to divert her, pointed away to the mountains.
&#8220;There is my dominion. Up there I am sole
ruler. No one can litter the earth with corruption or
poison the streams.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not speak, but as she studied the ranger her
face cleared. &#8220;It <i>is</i> beautiful up there.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went on. &#8220;I hate all this scrap-heap quite as heartily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
as you do, but up there is sweetness and sanity. The
streams are germless, and the forest cannot be devastated.
That is why I am a ranger. I could not endure life in
a town like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned up the street toward the high hill to the
south, and she kept step with him. As she did not speak,
he asked: &#8220;What did you expect to do out here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hoped to teach,&#8221; she replied, her voice still choked
with her emotion. &#8220;I expected to find the country much
improved.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And so it is; but it is still a long way from an Eastern
State. Perhaps you will find the people less savage than
they appear at first glance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t the town or the people, it is my mother!&#8221;
she burst forth again. &#8220;Tell me! A woman in the car
yesterday accused my mother of selling whiskey unlawfully.
Is this so? Tell me!&#8221;</p>
<p>She faced him resolutely, and perceiving that she
could not be evaded, he made slow answer. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
<i>know</i> that she does, but I&#8217;ve heard it charged against
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who made the charge?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the clergymen, and then it&#8217;s common talk
among the rough men of the town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that the worst they say of her? Be honest with
me&mdash;I want to know the worst.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was quite decisive as he said: &#8220;Yes, that is the
worst.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked relieved. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear you say so.
I&#8217;ve been imagining all kinds of terrifying things.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then, too, her bad health is some excuse for her
housekeeping,&#8221; he added, eager to lessen the daughter&#8217;s
humiliation, &#8220;and you must remember her associations
are not those which breed scrupulous regard for the
proprieties.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she&#8217;s my mother!&#8221; wailed the girl, coming back
to the central fact. &#8220;She has sent me money&mdash;she has
been kind to me&mdash;what am I to do? She needs me, and
yet the thought of staying here and facing her life frightens
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rotten board walks, the low rookeries, the unshaven,
blear-eyed men sitting on the thresholds of the
saloons, the slattern squaws wandering abroad like bedraggled
hens, made the girl stare with wonder and dismay.
She had remembered the town street as a highway
filled with splendid cavaliers, a list wherein heroic deeds
were done with horse and pistol.</p>
<p>She recognized one of those &#8220;knights of the lariat&#8221; sitting
in the sun, flabby, grizzled, and inert. Another was
trying to mount his horse with a bottle in his hand. She
recalled him perfectly. He had been her girlish ideal
of manly beauty. Now here he was, old and mangy with
drink at forty. In a most vivid and appealing sense he
measured the change in her as well as the decay of the
old-time cowboy. His incoherent salutation as his eyes
fell upon her was like the final blasphemous word from
the rear-guard of a savage tribe, and she watched him
ride away reeling limply in his saddle as one watches a
carrion-laden vulture take its flight.</p>
<p>She perceived in the ranger the man of the new order,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
and with this in her mind she said: &#8220;You don&#8217;t belong
here? You&#8217;re not a Western man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the sense of having been born here,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;I am, in fact, a native of England, though I&#8217;ve
lived nearly twenty years of my life in the States.&#8221;</p>
<p>She glanced at his badge. &#8220;How did you come to be a
ranger&mdash;what does it mean? It&#8217;s all new to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is new to the West,&#8221; he answered, smilingly, glad
of a chance to turn her thought from her own personal
griefs. &#8220;It has all come about since you went East.
Uncle Sam has at last become provident, and is now
&#8216;conserving his resources.&#8217; I am one of his representatives
with stewardship over some ninety thousand acres
of territory&mdash;mostly forest.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him with eyes of changing light. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t talk like an Englishman, and yet you are not like
the men out here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t care to be like some of them,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;My being here is quite logical. I went into the
cattle business like many another, and I went broke.
I served under Colonel Roosevelt in the Cuban War, and
after my term was out, naturally drifted back. I love the
wilderness and have some natural taste for forestry, and
I can ride and pack a horse as well as most cowboys,
hence my uniform. I&#8217;m not the best forest ranger in the
service, I&#8217;ll admit, but I fancy I&#8217;m a fair average.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that is your badge&mdash;the pine-tree?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and I am proud of it. Some of the fellows are
not, but so far as I am concerned I am glad to be known
as a defender of the forest. A tree means much to me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
I never mark one for felling without a sense of responsibility
to the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her questions came slowly, like those of a child.
&#8220;Where do you live?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Directly up the South Fork, about twenty miles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled. &#8220;Not much. I ride the trails, guard the
game, put out fires, scale lumber, burn brush, build
bridges, herd cattle, count sheep, survey land, and a few
other odd chores. It&#8217;s supposed to be a soft snap, but
I can&#8217;t see it that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you live alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, for the larger part of the time. I have an
assistant who is with me during part of the summer
months. Mostly I am alone. However, I am supposed
to keep open house, and I catch a visitor now and then.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were both more at ease now, and her unaffected
interest pleased him.</p>
<p>She went on, steadily: &#8220;Don&#8217;t you get very lonely?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In winter, sometimes; in summer I&#8217;m too busy to
get lonely. In the fire season I&#8217;m in the saddle every
day, and sometimes all night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who cooks for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do. That&#8217;s part of a ranger&#8217;s job. We have no
&#8216;servant problem&#8217; to contend with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you expect to do this always?&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled again. &#8220;There you touch my secret spring.
I have the hope of being Chief Forester some time&mdash;I
mean we all have the prospect of promotion to sustain us.
The service is so new that any one with even a knowledge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
of forestry is in demand; by and by real foresters will
arise.&#8221;</p>
<p>She returned abruptly to her own problem. &#8220;I dread
to go back to my mother, but I must. Oh, how I hate
that hotel! I loathe the flies, the smells, the people
that eat there, the waiters&mdash;everything!&#8221; She shuddered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of the evils you mention could be reformed&mdash;except,
of course, some of the people who come to eat.
I fear several of them have gone beyond reformation.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they started back down the street she saw the
motor-stage just leaving the door of the office. &#8220;That
settles one question,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t get away till
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where would you go if you broke camp&mdash;back to
the East?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; my mother thinks there is a place for me in
Sulphur City.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your case interests me deeply. I wish I could advise
you to stay, but this is a rough town for a girl like
you. Why don&#8217;t you talk the problem over with the
Supervisor?&#8221; His voice became firmer. &#8220;Mrs. Redfield
is the very one to help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where does she live?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Their ranch lies just above Sulphur, at the mouth
of the Canon. May I tell him what you&#8217;ve told me?
He&#8217;s a good sort, is Redfield&mdash;much better able to advise
than I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh found himself enjoying the confidence of
this girl so strangely thrown into his care, and the curious
comment of the people in the street did not disturb
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
him, except as it bore upon his companion&#8217;s position in
the town.</p>
<p>At the door of the hotel some half-a-dozen men were
clustered. As the young couple approached they gave
way, but a short, powerful man, whom Lee Virginia
recognized as Gregg the sheepman, called to the
ranger:</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to see you before you leave town, Mr. Ranger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. I shall be here all the forenoon,&#8221; answered
Cavanagh, in the tone of a man accepting a
challenge; then, turning to the girl, he said, earnestly:
&#8220;I want to help you. I shall be here for lunch, and meanwhile
I wish you would take Redfield into your confidence.
He&#8217;s a wise old boy, and everybody knows him.
No one doubts his motives; besides, he has a family,
and is rich and unhurried. Would you like me to talk
with him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will. I want to do right&mdash;indeed I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure of that,&#8221; he said, with eyes upon her flushed
and quivering face. &#8220;There&#8217;s a way out, believe me.&#8221;</p>
<p>They parted on the little porch of the hotel, and her
eyes followed his upright figure till he entered one of the
shops. He had precisely the look and bearing of a young
lieutenant in the regular army, and she wondered what
Gregg&#8217;s demand meant. In his voice was both menace
and contempt.</p>
<p>She returned to her own room, strangely heartened by
her talk with the ranger. &#8220;If I stay here another night
this room must be cleaned,&#8221; she decided, and approached
the bed as though it harbored venomous reptiles. &#8220;This
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
is one of the things that must be reformed,&#8221; she decided,
harking back to the ranger&#8217;s quiet remark.</p>
<p>She was still pondering ways and means of making
the room habitable when her mother came in.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you sleep last night?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee Virginia could not bring herself to lie. &#8220;Not very
well,&#8221; she admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither did I. Fact of the matter is your coming
fairly upset me. I&#8217;ve been kind o&#8217; used up for three
months. I don&#8217;t know what ails me. I&#8217;d ought to go
up to Sulphur to see a doctor, but there don&#8217;t seem to be
any free time. I &#8217;pear to have lost my grip. Food
don&#8217;t give me any strength. I saw you talking with
Ross Cavanagh. There&#8217;s a man&mdash;and Reddy. Reddy
is what you may call a fancy rancher&mdash;goes in for alfalfy
and fruit, and all that. He isn&#8217;t in the forest service for
the pay or for graft. He&#8217;s got a regular palace up there
above Sulphur&mdash;hot and cold water all through the
house, a furnace in the cellar, and two bath-rooms, so
they tell me; I never was in the place. Well, I must
go back&mdash;I can&#8217;t trust them girls a minute.&#8221; She turned
with a groan of pain. &#8220;&#8217;Pears like every joint in me is
a-creakin&#8217; to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t I take your place?&#8221; asked Lee Virginia, pity
deepening in her heart as she caught the look of suffering
on her mother&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; you better keep out o&#8217; the caffy. It ain&#8217;t a fit
place for you. Fact is, I weren&#8217;t expecting anything so
fine as you are. I laid awake till three o&#8217;clock last night
figurin&#8217; on what to do. I reckon you&#8217;d better go back and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
give this outfit up as a bad job. I used to tell Ed you
didn&#8217;t belong to neither of us, and you don&#8217;t. I can&#8217;t
see where you <i>did</i> come from&mdash;anyhow, I don&#8217;t want the
responsibility of havin&#8217; you here. Why, you&#8217;ll have half
the men in the county hitchin&#8217; to my corral&mdash;and the
males out here are a fierce lot o&#8217; brutes.&#8221; She studied the
girl again, finding her so dainty, so far above herself,
that she added: &#8220;It would be a cruel shame for me to keep
you here, with all these he-wolves roamin&#8217; around.
You&#8217;re too good to be meat for any of them. You just
plan to pack up and pull out to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>She went out with a dragging step that softened the
girl&#8217;s heart. It was true there was little of real affection
between them. Her memories of Eliza up to this moment
had been rather mixed. As a child she had seldom
been in her arms, and she had always been a little afraid
of the bold, bright, handsome creature who rode horses
and shot pistols like a man. It was hard to relate the
Eliza Wetherford of those days with this flabby, limping
old woman, and yet her daughter came nearer to loving
her at this moment than at any time since her fifth year.</p>

<h2>III</h2>
<h3>LEE VIRGINIA WAGES WAR</h3>
</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>In</span> truth, Lize had risen that morning intending &#8220;to
whirl in and clean up the house,&#8221; being suddenly conscious
to some degree of the dirt and disorder around her,
but she found herself physically unequal to the task.
Her brain seemed misted, and her food had been a source
of keen pain to her. Hence, after a few half-hearted
orders, she had settled into her broad chair behind the
counter and there remained, brooding over her maternal
responsibilities.</p>
<p>She gave sharp answers to all the men who came up to
ask after her daughter, and to one who remarked on the
girl&#8217;s good looks, and demanded an introduction, she
said: &#8220;Get along! I&#8217;d as soon introduce her to a goat.
Now you fellers want to understand I&#8217;ll kill the man that
sets out to fool with my girl, I tell you that!&#8221;</p>
<p>While yet Lee Virginia was wondering how to begin the
day&#8217;s work, some one knocked on her door, and in answer
to her invitation a woman stepped in&mdash;a thin blond hag
with a weak smile and watery blue eyes. &#8220;Is this little
Lee Virginy?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>The girl rose. &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, howdy!&#8221; She extended her hand, and Lee took
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
it. &#8220;My name&#8217;s Jackson&mdash;Mrs. Orlando Jackson. I
knew yore pa and you before &#8216;the war.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee Virginia dimly recalled such a family, and asked:
&#8220;Where do you live?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We hole up down here on a ranch about twenty
miles&mdash;stayed with yore ma last night&mdash;thought I&#8217;d jest
nacherly look in and say howdy. Are ye back fer to
stay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think so. Will you sit down?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jackson took a seat. &#8220;Come back to see how
yore ma was, I reckon? Found her pretty porely, didn&#8217;t
ye?&#8221; She lowered her voice. &#8220;I think she&#8217;s got cancer
of the stummick&mdash;now that&#8217;s my guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia started. &#8220;What makes you think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I knew a woman who went just that way. Had
that same flabby, funny look&mdash;and that same distress
after eatin&#8217;, I told her this mornin&#8217; she&#8217;d better go up
to Sulphur and see that new doctor. You see, yore ma
has always been a reckless kind of a critter&mdash;more like a
man than a woman, God knows&mdash;an&#8217; how she ever got
a girl like you I don&#8217;t fairly understand. I reckon you
must be what the breedin&#8217; men call &#8216;a throw-back,&#8217; for
yore pa wa&#8216;n&#8217;t much to brag of, &#8216;ceptin&#8217; for looks&mdash;he
certainly was good-lookin&#8217;. He used to sober down when
he got where you was; but my&mdash;good God!&mdash;weren&#8217;t they
a pair to draw to? I&#8217;ve heard &#8217;Lando tell tales of yore
ma&#8217;s doin&#8217;s that would &#8217;fright ye. Not that she fooled
with men,&#8221; she hastened to say. &#8220;Lord, no! For her
the sun rose and set in Ed Wetherford. She&#8217;d leave you
any day, and go on the round-up with him. It nigh
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
about broke her up in business when Ed hit the far-away
trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl perceived that in her visitor she had one of
these self-oiled human talking-machines &#8220;with tongue
hung in the middle,&#8221; as the old saying goes, and she was
dimly conscious of having heard her many times before.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t look very well yourself,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me? Oh, I&#8217;m like one o&#8217; these Injun dawgs&mdash;can&#8217;t
kill me. I&#8217;ve been on the range so long I&#8217;m tough as
dried beef. It&#8217;s a fierce old place for a woman&mdash;or it
was before &#8216;the war&#8217;&mdash;since then it&#8217;s kind o&#8217; softened
down a hair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by &#8216;the war&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you remember the rustler war? We date
everything out here from that year. You was here, for
I saw ye&mdash;a slob of a child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; exclaimed Virginia. &#8220;I understand now. Yes,
I was here. I saw my father at the head of the cowboys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They weren&#8217;t cowboys; they were hired killers from
Texas. That&#8217;s what let yore pa out o&#8217; the State. He
were on the wrong side, and if it hadn&#8217;t &#8216;a&#8217; been for the
regular soldiers he&#8217;d &#8216;a&#8217; been wiped out right hyer. As
it was he had to skip the range, and hain&#8217;t never been
back. I don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose folks will lay it up agin you&mdash;bein&#8217;
a girl&mdash;but they couldn&#8217;t no <i>son</i> of Ed Wetherford come
back here and settle, not for a minute. Why, yore ma
has had to bluff the whole county a&#8217;most&mdash;not that <i>I</i> lay
anything up agin her. I tell folks she was that bewitched
with Ed she couldn&#8217;t see things any way but
his way. She fought to save his ranch and stawk and&mdash;but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
hell! she couldn&#8217;t do nothin&#8217;&mdash;and then to have him
go back on her the way he did&mdash;slip out &#8217;twixt two
days, and never write; that just about shot her to pieces.
I never could understand that in Ed, he &#8217;peared so mortally
fond of you and of her, too. He sure was fond of
you!&#8221; She shook her head. &#8220;No, can&#8217;t anybody make
me believe Ed Wetherford is alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee Virginia started. &#8220;Who says he&#8217;s alive?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t get excited, girl. He ain&#8217;t alive; but
yet folks say we don&#8217;t <i>know</i> he&#8217;s dead. He jest dropped
out so far as yore ma is concerned, and so far as the
county is concerned; but some thought you was with
him in the East.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl was now aware that her visitor was hoping
to gain some further information, and so curtly answered:
&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen my father since that night the soldiers
came and took him away to the fort. And my mother
told me he died down in Texas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jackson seemed a little disappointed, but she
smoothed the dress over her sharp knees, and continued:
&#8220;Right there the good old days ended for yore ma&mdash;and
for us. The cattle business has been steadily on the
chute&mdash;that is, the free-range business. I saw it comin&#8217;,
an&#8217; I says to Jackson, &#8216;Camp on some river-bottom and
chuck in the alfalfy,&#8217; I says. An&#8217; that&#8217;s what we did.
We got a little bunch o&#8217; cattle up in the park&mdash;Uncle
Sam&#8217;s man is lookin&#8217; after &#8217;em.&#8221; She grinned. &#8220;Jackson
kicked at the fee, but I says: &#8216;Twenty cents a head
is cheap pasture. We&#8217;re lucky to get any grass at
all, now that everybody&#8217;s goin&#8217; in for sheep. &#8217;Pears
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
like the sheepmen air gettin&#8217; bolder and bolder in this
free-range graft, and I&#8217;m a-bettin&#8217; on trouble.&#8217;&#8221; She
rose. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad to &#8217;ve had a word with ye; but
you hear me: yore ma has got to have doctor&#8217;s help, or
she&#8217;s a-goin&#8217; to fall down some day soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every word the woman uttered, every tone of her
drawling voice, put Lee Virginia back into the past.
She heard again the swift gallop of hooves, saw once more
the long line of armed ranchers, and felt the hush of fear
that lay over the little town on that fateful day. The
situation became clearer in her mind. She recalled
vividly the words of astonishment and hate with which
the women had greeted her mother on the morning when
the news came that Edward Wetherford was among the
invading cattle-barons&mdash;was, indeed, one of the leaders.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia the Rocky Mountain States were
synonyms of picturesque lawlessness, the theatre of
reckless romance, and Virginia Wetherford, loyal daughter
of the West, had defended it; but in the coarse phrase
of this lean rancheress was pictured a land of border
warfare as ruthless as that which marked the Scotland of
Rob Roy.</p>
<p>Commonplace as the little town looked at the moment,
it had been the scene of many a desperate encounter, as
the girl herself could testify, for she had seen more than
one man killed therein. Some way the hideousness of
these scenes had never shown itself to her&mdash;perhaps because
she had been a child at the time, and had thrilled
to the delicious excitement of it; but now, as she imagined
it all happening again before her eyes, she shivered with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
horror. How monstrous, how impossible those killings
now seemed!</p>
<p>Then her mind came back to her mother&#8217;s ailment.
Eliza Wetherford had never been one to complain, and
her groans meant real suffering.</p>
<p>Her mind resolved upon one thing. &#8220;She must see a
doctor,&#8221; she decided. And with this in mind she reentered
the café, where Lize was again in violent altercation
with a waitress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; called Lee, &#8220;I want to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a parting volley of vituperation, Mrs. Wetherford
followed her daughter back into the lodging-house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; the girl began, facing her and speaking
firmly, &#8220;you must go to Sulphur City and see a doctor.
I&#8217;ll stay here and look after the business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wetherford perceived in her daughter&#8217;s attitude
and voice something decisive and powerful. She sank
into a chair, and regarded her with intent gaze. &#8220;Hett
Jackson&#8217;s been gabblin&#8217; to you,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;Hett
knows more fool things that ain&#8217;t so than any old heffer
I know. She said I was about all in, didn&#8217;t she? Prophesied
I&#8217;d fall down and stay? I know her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee Virginia remained firm. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going by what
she said, I&#8217;ve got eyes of my own. You need help, and if
the doctor here can&#8217;t help you, you must go to Sulphur
or to Kansas City. I can run the boarding-house till you
get back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eliza eyed her curiously. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you go to countin&#8217;
on this &#8216;chivalry of the West&#8217; which story-writers put into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
books. These men out here will eat you up if you don&#8217;t
watch out. I wouldn&#8217;t dare to leave you here alone.
No, what I&#8217;ll do is sell the place, if I can, and both of us
get out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you need a doctor this minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be all right in a little while; I&#8217;m always the worst
for an hour or two after I eat. This little squirt of a
local doctor gave me some dope to ease that pain, but
I&#8217;ve got my doubts&mdash;I don&#8217;t want any morphine habit in
mine. No, daughter Virginny, it&#8217;s mighty white of you
to offer, but you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re up against when
you contract to step into my shoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Visions of reforming methods about the house passed
through the girl&#8217;s mind. &#8220;There must be something I
can do. Why don&#8217;t you have the doctor come down
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I might do that if I get any worse, but I hate to have
you stay in the house another night. It&#8217;s only fit for
these goats of cowboys and women like Hett Jackson.
Did the bugs eat you last night?&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia flushed. &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eliza&#8217;s face fell. &#8220;I was afraid of that. You can&#8217;t
keep &#8217;em out. The cowboys bring &#8217;em in by the quart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They can be destroyed&mdash;and the flies, too, can&#8217;t
they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;ve bucked flies and bugs as long as I
have, you&#8217;ll be less &#8217;peart about it. I don&#8217;t care a hoot
in Hades till somebody like you or Reddy or Ross comes
along. Most of the men that camp with me are like
Injuns, anyway&mdash;they wouldn&#8217;t feel natural without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
bugs a ticklin&#8217; &#8217;em. No, child, you get ready and pull
out on the Sulphur stage to-morrow. I&#8217;ll pay your way
back to Philadelphy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t leave you now, mother. Now that I know
you&#8217;re ill, I&#8217;m going to stay and take care of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lize rose. &#8220;See here, girl, don&#8217;t you go to idealizin&#8217;
me, neither. I&#8217;m what the boys call an old battle-axe.
I&#8217;ve been through the whole war. I&#8217;m able to feed myself
and pay your board besides. Just you find some
decent boarding-place in Sulphur, and I&#8217;ll see that you
have ten dollars a week to live on, just because you&#8217;re
a Wetherford.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m your daughter!&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Eliza fixed a musing look upon her. &#8220;I reckon
if the truth was known your aunt Celia was nigher to
being your mother than I ever was. They always said
you was all Wetherford, and I reckon they were right.
I always liked men better than babies. So long as I
had your father, you didn&#8217;t count&mdash;now that&#8217;s the God&#8217;s
truth. And I didn&#8217;t intend that you should ever come
back here. I urged you to stay&mdash;you know that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee Virginia imagined all this to be a savage self-accusation
which sprang from long self-bereavement,
and yet there was something terrifying in its brutal
frankness. She stood in silence till her mother left the
room, then went to her own chamber with a painful knot
in her throat. What could she do with elemental savagery
of this sort?</p>
<p>The knowledge that she must spend another night in
the bed led her to active measures of reform. With disgustful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
desperation, she emptied the room and swept it
as with fire and sword. Her change of mind, from the
passive to the active state, relieved and stimulated her,
and she hurried from one needed reform to another.
She drew others into the vortex. She inspired the
chambermaid to unwilling yet amazing effort, and the
lodging-house endured such a blast from the besom
that it stood in open-windowed astonishment uttering
dust like the breath of a dragon. Having swept and
garnished the bed-chambers, Virginia moved on the
dining-room. As the ranger had said, this, too, could
be reformed.</p>
<p>Unheeding her mother&#8217;s protests, she organized the
giggling waiters into a warring party, and advanced upon
the flies. By hissing and shooing, and the flutter of
newspapers, they drove the enemy before them, and
a carpenter was called in to mend screen doors and windows,
thus preventing their return. New shades were
hung to darken the room, and new table-cloths purchased
to replace the old ones, and the kitchen had
such a cleaning as it had not known before in five
years.</p>
<p>In this work the time passed swiftly, and when Redfield
and Cavanagh came again to lunch they exclaimed
in astonishment&mdash;as, indeed, every one did.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s this?&#8221; queried Cavanagh, humorously. &#8220;Has
the place &#8217;changed hands?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lize was but grimly responsive. &#8220;Seem&#8217;s like it has.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope the price has not gone up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>Redfield asked: &#8220;Who&#8217;s responsible for this&mdash;your
new daughter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve hit it. She&#8217;s started right in to polish us all
up to city standards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We need it,&#8221; commented Cavanagh, in admiration of
the girl&#8217;s prompt action. &#8220;This room is almost civilized,
still we&#8217;ll sort o&#8217; miss the flies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lize apologized. &#8220;Well, you know a feller gits kind o&#8217;
run down like a clock, and has to have some outsider
wind him up now and again. First I was mad, then I
was scared, but now I&#8217;m cheerin&#8217; the girl on. She can
run the whole blame outfit if she&#8217;s a mind to&mdash;even if I
go broke for it. The work she got out o&#8217; them slatter-heels
of girls is a God&#8217;s wonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross looked round for Virginia, but could not find her.
She had seen him come in, and was out in the kitchen
doing what she could to have his food brought in and
properly served.</p>
<p>Redfield reassured the perturbed proprietor of &#8220;the
joint.&#8221; &#8220;No fear of going broke, madam&mdash;quite the
contrary. A few little touches like this, and you&#8217;ll be
obliged to tear down and build bigger. I don&#8217;t believe
I&#8217;d like to see your daughter run this eating-house as
a permanent job, but if she starts in I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll make
a success of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee Virginia came in flushed and self-conscious, but
far lighter of spirit than at breakfast; and stood beside
the table while the waitress <i>laid</i> the dishes before her
guests with elaborate assumption of grace and design.
Hitherto she had bumped them down with a slash of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
slangy comment. The change was quite as wonderful
as the absence of the flies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do we owe these happy reforms to you?&#8221; asked
Cavanagh, admiring Virginia&#8217;s neat dress and glowing
cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Partly,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I was desperate. I had
to do something, so I took to ordering people around.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you sit at our table
again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please do,&#8221; said Redfield. &#8220;I want to talk with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took a seat&mdash;a little hesitantly. &#8220;You see, I
studied Domestic Science at school, and I&#8217;ve never had
a chance to apply it before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your opportunity,&#8221; Redfield assured her.
&#8220;My respect for the science of domestics is growing&mdash;I
marvel to think what another week will bring forth.
I think I&#8217;ll have to come down again just to observe the
improvement in the place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t last,&#8221; Lize interjected. &#8220;She&#8217;ll catch the
Western habits&mdash;she&#8217;ll sag, same as we all do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No she won&#8217;t,&#8221; declared Ross, with intent to encourage
her. &#8220;If you give her a free hand, I predict she&#8217;ll
make your place the wonder and boast of the county-side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When do you go back to the mountains?&#8221; Lee Virginia
asked, a little later.</p>
<p>&#8220;Immediately after my luncheon,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>She experienced a pang of regret, and could not help
showing it a little. &#8220;Your talk helped me,&#8221; she said;
&#8220;I&#8217;ve decided to stay, and be of use to my mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>Redfield overheard this, and turned toward her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This is a rough school for you, Lee Virginia, and I
should dislike seeing you settle down to it for life: but it
can&#8217;t hurt you if you are what I think you are. Nothing
can soil or mar the mind that wills for good. I want
Mrs. Redfield to know you; I&#8217;m sure her advice will be
helpful. I hope you&#8217;ll come up and see us if you decide
to settle in Sulphur&mdash;or if you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to do so,&#8221; she said, touched by the tone
as well as by the words of his invitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Redfield&#8217;s house is one of the few completely civilized
homes in the State,&#8221; put in Cavanagh. &#8220;When I get so
weary of cuss-words and poaching and graft that I can&#8217;t
live without killing some one, I go down to Elk Lodge
and smoke and read the Supervisor&#8217;s London and Paris
weeklies and recover my tone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Redfield smiled. &#8220;When I get weak-kneed or careless
in the service and feel my self-respect slipping away, I
go up to Ross&#8217;s cabin and talk with a man who represents
the impersonal, even-handed justice of the Federal law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh laughed. &#8220;There! Having handed each
other reciprocal bouquets, we can now tell Miss Wetherford
the truth. Each of us thinks very well of himself,
and we&#8217;re both believers in the New West.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by the New West?&#8221; asked the
girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the work you&#8217;ve been doing here this morning
is a part of it,&#8221; answered Redfield. &#8220;It&#8217;s a kind of housecleaning.
The Old West was picturesque and, in a way,
manly and fine&mdash;certain phases of it were heroic&mdash;and I
hate to see it all pass, but some of us began to realize that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
it was not all poetry. The plain truth is my companions
for over twenty years were lawless ruffians, and the cattle
business as we practiced it in those days was founded on
selfishness and defended at the mouth of the pistol. We
were all pensioners on Uncle Sam, and fighting to keep
the other fellow off from having a share of his bounty.
It was all wasteful, half-savage. We didn&#8217;t want settlement,
we didn&#8217;t want law, we didn&#8217;t want a State. We
wanted free range. We were a line of pirates from beginning
to end, and we&#8217;re not wholly, reformed yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was talking to the whole table now, for all were
listening. No other man on the range could say these
things with the same authority, for Hugh Redfield was
known all over the State as a man who had been one of the
best riders and ropers in his outfit&mdash;one who had started
in as a common hand at herding, and who had been entirely
through &#8220;the war.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee Virginia listened with a stirring of the blood. Her
recollections of the range were all of the heroic. She
recalled the few times when she was permitted to go on
the round-up, and to witness the breaking of new horses,
and the swiftness, grace, and reckless bravery of the
riders, the moan and surge of herds, the sweep of horsemen,
came back and filled her mind with large and free
and splendid pictures. And now it was passing&mdash;or
past!</p>
<p>Some one at the table accused Redfield of being more
of a town-site boomer than a cattle-man.</p>
<p>He was quite unmoved by this charge. &#8220;The town-site
boomer at least believes in progress. He does not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
go so far as to shut out settlement. If a neat and tidy
village or a well-ordered farmstead is not considered
superior to a cattle-ranch littered with bones and tin
cans, or better than even a cow-town whose main industry
is whiskey-selling, then all civilized progress is
a delusion. When I was a youngster these considerations
didn&#8217;t trouble me. I liked the cowboy life and the careless
method of the plains, but I&#8217;ve some girls growing
up now, and I begin to see the whole business in a new
light. I don&#8217;t care to have my children live the life I&#8217;ve
lived. Besides, what right have we to stand in the way
of a community&#8217;s growth? Suppose the new life <i>is</i> less
picturesque than the old? We don&#8217;t like to leave behind
us the pleasures and sports of boyhood; but we
grow up, nevertheless. I&#8217;m far more loyal to the State
as Forest Supervisor than I was when I was riding with
the cattle-men to scare up the nester.&#8221;</p>
<p>He uttered all this quite calmly, but his ease of manner,
his absolute disregard of consequences, joined with
his wealth and culture, gave his words great weight and
power. No one was ready with an answer but Lize,
who called out, with mocking accent: &#8220;Reddy, you&#8217;re too
good for the Forest Service, you&#8217;d ought &#8217;o be our next
Governor.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was a centre shot. Redfield flushed, and Cavanagh
laughed. &#8220;Mr. Supervisor, you are discovered!&#8221;</p>
<p>Redfield recovered himself. &#8220;I should like to be
Governor of this State for about four years, but I&#8217;m
likelier to be lynched for being in command of twenty
&#8216;Cossacks.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>At this moment Sam Gregg entered the room, followed
by a young man in an English riding-suit. Seeing that
&#8220;the star-boarder table&#8221; offered a couple of seats, they
pointed that way. Sam was plainly in war-like frame
of mind, and slammed his sombrero on its nail with the
action of a man beating an adversary.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is Sam Gregg and his son Joe&mdash;used to be
ranch cattle-man, now one of our biggest sheepmen,&#8221;
Cavanagh explained. &#8220;He&#8217;s bucking the cattle-men now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee Virginia studied young Gregg with interest, for
his dress was that of a man to whom money came easy,
and his face was handsome, though rather fat and sullen.
In truth, he had been brought into the room by his
father to see &#8220;Lize Wetherford&#8217;s girl,&#8221; and his eyes at
once sought and found her. A look of surprise and
pleasure at once lit his face.</p>
<p>Gregg was sullen because of his interview with Cavanagh,
which had been in the nature of a grapple; and in
the light of what Redfield had said, Lee Virginia was able
to perceive in these two men a struggle for supremacy.
Gregg was the greedy West checked and restrained by
the law.</p>
<p>Every man in the room knew that Gregg was a bitter
opponent of the Forest Service, and that he &#8220;had it in&#8221;
for the ranger; and some of them knew that he was
throwing more sheep into the forest than his permits
allowed, and that a clash with Redfield was sure to
come. It was just like the burly old Irishman to go
straight to the table where his adversary sat.</p>
<p>Virginia&#8217;s eyes fell before the gaze of these two men,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
for they had none of the shyness or nothing of the indirection
of the ruder men she had met. They expressed
something which angered her, though she could not have
told precisely why.</p>
<p>Redfield did not soften his words on Gregg&#8217;s account;
on the contrary he made them still more cutting and to
the line.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mere fact that I live near the open range or a
national forest does not give me any <i>rights</i> in the range or
forest,&#8221; he was saying, as Gregg took his seat. &#8220;I enjoy
the <i>privilege</i> of these Government grazing grounds, and
I ought to be perfectly willing to pay the fee. These
forests are the property of the whole nation; they are
public lands, and should yield a revenue to the whole
nation. It is silly to expect the Government to go on enriching
a few of us stockmen at the expense of others.
I see this, and I accept the change.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After you&#8217;ve got rich at it,&#8221; said Gregg.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221; retorted Redfield. &#8220;Are you
so greedy that nothing will stop you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lize threw in a wise word. &#8220;The sporting-houses of
Kansas City and Chicago keep old Sam poor.&#8221;</p>
<p>A roar of laughter followed this remark, and Gregg
was stumped for a moment; but the son grinned appreciatively.
&#8220;Now be good!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh turned to Virginia in haste to shield her
from all that lay behind and beneath this sally of the older
and deeply experienced woman. &#8220;The Supervisor is
willing to yield a point&mdash;he knows what the New West
will bring.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>Gregg growled out: &#8220;I&#8217;m not letting any of my rights
slip.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl was troubled by the war-light which she saw
in the faces of the men about her, and vague memories
of the words and stories she had overchanced to hear
in her childhood came back to her mind&mdash;hints of the
drunken orgies of the cowboys who went to the city with
cattle, and the terrifying suggestion of their attitude
toward all womankind. She set Cavanagh and his chief
quite apart from all the others in the room, and at first
felt that in young Gregg was another man of education
and right living&mdash;but in this she was misled.</p>
<p>Lize had confidence enough in the ranger to throw in
another malicious word. &#8220;Ross, old Bullfrog came down
here to chase you up a tree&mdash;so he said. Did he do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gregg looked ugly. &#8220;I&#8217;m not done with this business.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned to Ross. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let him scare you&mdash;his
beller is a whole lot worse than his bite.&#8221;</p>
<p>This provoked another laugh, and Gregg was furious&mdash;all
the more so that his son joined in. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have your
head, Mr. Supervisor; I&#8217;ll carry my fight to the Secretary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; returned Redfield, &#8220;carry it to the President
if you wish. I simply repeat that your sheep must
correspond to your permit, and if you don&#8217;t send up and
remove the extra number I will do it myself. I don&#8217;t
make the rules of the department. My job is to carry
them out.&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time every person in the room was tense with
interest. They all knew Gregg and his imperious
methods. He was famous for saying once (when in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
cup): &#8220;I always thought sheepmen were blankety
blank sons of guns, and now I&#8217;m one of &#8217;em I <i>know</i> they
are.&#8221; Some of the cattle-men in the room had suffered
from his greed, and while they were not partisans of the
Supervisor they were glad to see him face his opponent
fearlessly.</p>
<p>Lize delivered a parting blow. &#8220;Bullfrog, you and
me are old-timers. We&#8217;re on the losing side. We belong
to the &#8216;good old days&#8217; when the Fork was &#8216;a man&#8217;s
town,&#8217; and to be &#8216;shot up&#8217; once a week kept us in news.
But them times are past. You can&#8217;t run the range that
way any more. Why, man, you&#8217;ll have to buy and fence
your own pasture in a few years more, or else pay rent
same as I do. You stockmen kick like steers over paying
a few old cents a head for five months&#8217; range; you&#8217;ll
be mighty glad to pay a dollar one o&#8217; these days. Take
your medicine&mdash;that&#8217;s my advice.&#8221; And she went back
to her cash-drawer.</p>
<p>Redfield&#8217;s voice was cuttingly contemptuous as he
said quite calmly: &#8220;You&#8217;re all kinds of asses, you
sheepmen. You ought to pay the fee for your cattle
with secret joy. So long as you can get your stock
pastured (and in effect guarded) by the Government
from June to November for twenty cents, or even fifty
cents, per head you&#8217;re in luck. Mrs. Wetherford is right:
we&#8217;ve all been educated in a bad school. Uncle Sam has
been too bloomin&#8217; lazy to keep any supervision over his
public lands. He&#8217;s permitted us grass pirates to fight
and lynch and burn one another on the high range (to
which neither of us had any right), holding back the real
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
user of the land&mdash;the farmer. We&#8217;ve played the part of
selfish and greedy gluttons so long that we fancy our
privileges have turned into rights. Having grown rich
on free range, you&#8217;re now fighting the Forest Service
because it is disposed to make you pay for what has
been a gratuity. I&#8217;m a hog, Gregg, but I&#8217;m not a
fool. I see the course of empire, and I&#8217;m getting into
line.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gregg was silenced, but not convinced. &#8220;It&#8217;s a long
lane that has no turn,&#8221; he growled.</p>
<p>Redfield resumed, in impersonal heat. &#8220;The cow-man
was conceived in anarchy and educated in murder.
Whatever romantic notions I may have had of the plains
twenty-five years ago, they are lost to me now. The
free-range stock-owner has no country and no God;
nothing but a range that isn&#8217;t his, and damned bad manners&mdash;begging
pardon, Miss Wetherford. The sooner
he dies the better for the State. He&#8217;s a dirty, wasteful
sloven, content to eat canned beans and drink canned
milk in his rotten bad coffee; and nobody but an old
crank like myself has the grace to stand up and tell the
truth about him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh smiled. &#8220;And you wouldn&#8217;t, if you weren&#8217;t
a man of independent means, and known to be one of the
most experienced cow-punchers in the county. I&#8217;ve no
fight with men like Gregg; all is they&#8217;ve got to conform
to the rules of the service.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gregg burst out: &#8220;You think you&#8217;re the whole United
States army! Who gives you all the authority?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Congress and the President.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing in that bill to warrant these petty
tyrannies of yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you call tyrannies I call defending the public
domain,&#8221; replied Redfield. &#8220;If I had my way, I&#8217;d give
my rangers the power of the Canadian mounted police.
Is there any other State in this nation where the roping
of sheep-herders and the wholesale butchery of sheep
would be permitted? From the very first the public
lands of this State have been a refuge for the criminal&mdash;a
lawless no-man&#8217;s land; but now, thanks to Roosevelt
and the Chief Forester, we at least have a force of men
on the spot to see that some semblance of law and order
is maintained. You fellows may protest and run to
Washington, and you may send your paid representatives
there, but you&#8217;re sure to lose. As free-range monopolists
you are cumberers of the earth, and all you represent
must pass, before this State can be anything but the
byword it now is. I didn&#8217;t feel this so keenly ten years
ago, but with a bunch of children growing up my vision
has grown clearer. The picturesque West must give
way to the civilized West, and the war of sheepmen and
cattle-men must stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>The whole dining-room was still as he finished, and Lee
Virginia, with a girl&#8217;s vague comprehension of the man&#8217;s
world, apprehended in Redfield&#8217;s speech a large and
daring purpose.</p>
<p>Gregg sneered. &#8220;Perhaps you intend to run for Congress
on that line of talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Redfield&#8217;s voice was placid. &#8220;At any rate, I intend to
represent the policy that will change this State from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
sparsely settled battle-ground of a lot of mounted hobos
to a State with an honorable place among the other commonwealths.
If this be treason, make the most of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh was disturbed; for while he felt the truth of
his chief&#8217;s words, he was in doubt as to the policy of
uttering them.</p>
<p>It was evident to Virginia that the cow-men, as well as
Gregg, were nearly all against the prophet of the future,
and she was filled with a sense of having arrived on the
scene just as the curtain to a stern and purposeful drama
was being raised. With her recollections of the savage
days of old, it seemed as if Redfield, by his bold words,
had placed his life in danger.</p>
<p>Cavanagh rose. &#8220;I must be going,&#8221; he said, with a
smile.</p>
<p>Again the pang of loss touched her heart. &#8220;When
will you come again?&#8221; she asked, in a low voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is hard to say. A ranger&#8217;s place is in the forest.
I am very seldom in town. Just now the danger of fires
is great, and I am very uneasy. I may not be down again
for a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>The table was empty now, and they were standing in
comparative isolation looking into each other&#8217;s eyes in
silence. At last she murmured: &#8220;You&#8217;ve helped me. I&#8217;m
going to stay&mdash;a little while, anyway, and do what I
can&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I can&#8217;t be of actual service, but I am a
soldier with a work to do. Even if I were here, I could not
help you as regards the townspeople&mdash;they all hate me
quite cordially; but Redfield, and especially Mrs. Redfield,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
can be of greater aid and comfort. He&#8217;s quite often here,
and when you are lonely and discouraged let him take
you up to Elk Lodge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been working all the morning to make this room
decent. It was rather fun. Don&#8217;t you think it helped?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw the mark of your hand the moment I entered
the door,&#8221; he earnestly replied. &#8220;I&#8217;m not one that
laughs at the small field of woman&#8217;s work. If you
make this little hotel clean and homelike, you&#8217;ll be doing
a very considerable work in bringing about the New West
which the Supervisor is spouting about.&#8221; He extended
his hand, and as she took it he thrilled to the soft strength
of it. &#8220;Till next time,&#8221; he said, &#8220;good luck!&#8221;</p>
<p>She watched him go with a feeling of pain&mdash;as if in his
going she were losing her best friend and most valiant
protector.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>
<h3>VIRGINIA TAKES ANOTHER MOTOR RIDE</h3>
</div>

<p>Lee Virginia&#8217;s efforts to refine the little hotel produced
an amazing change in Eliza Wetherford&#8217;s affairs. The
dining-room swarmed with those seeking food, and as the
news of the girl&#8217;s beauty went out upon the range, the
cowboys sought excuse to ride in and get a square meal
and a glimpse of the &#8220;Queen&#8221; whose hand had witched
&#8220;the old shack&#8221; into a marvel of cleanliness.</p>
<p>Say what you will, beauty is a sovereign appeal. These
men, unspeakably profane, cruel, and obscene in their
saddle-talk, were awed by the fresh linen, the burnished
glass, and the well-ordered tables which they found in
place of the flies, the dirt, and the disorder of aforetime.
&#8220;It&#8217;s worth a day&#8217;s ride just to see that girl for a minute,&#8221;
declared one enthusiast.</p>
<p>They did not all use the napkins, but they enjoyed
having them there beside their plates, and the subdued
light, the freedom from insects impressed them almost
to decorum. They entered with awe, avid for a word
with &#8220;Lize Wetherford&#8217;s girl.&#8221; Generally they failed
of so much as a glance at her, for she kept away from the
dining-room at meal-time.</p>
<p>Lee Virginia was fully aware of this male curiosity,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
and vaguely conscious of the merciless light which shone
in the eyes of some of them (men like Gregg), who went
about their game with the shameless directness of the
brute. She had begun to understand, too, that her
mother&#8217;s reputation was a barrier between the better
class of folk and herself; but as they came now and again
to take a meal, they permitted themselves a word in her
praise, which she resented. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want their friendship
<i>now</i>,&#8221; she declared, bitterly.</p>
<p>As she gained courage to look about her, she began
to be interested in some of her coatless, collarless
boarders on account of their extraordinary history.
There was Brady, the old government scout, retired on
a pension, who was accustomed to sit for hours on the
porch, gazing away over the northern plains&mdash;never
toward the mountains&mdash;as if he watched for bear or
bison, or for the files of hostile red hunters&mdash;though in
reality there was nothing to see but the stage, coming
and going, or a bunch of cowboys galloping into town.
Nevertheless, every cloud of dust was to him diversion,
and he appeared to dream, like a captive eagle, bedraggled,
spiritless, but with an inner spark of memory
burning deep in his dim blue eyes.</p>
<p>Then there was an old miner, distressingly filthy, who
hobbled to his meals on feet that had been frozen into
clubs. He had a little gold loaned at interest, and on
this he lived in tragic parsimony. He and the old scout
sat much together, usually without speech (each knew
to the last word the other&#8217;s stories), as if they recognized
each other&#8217;s utter loneliness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>Sifton, the old remittance man, had been born to a
higher culture, therefore was his degradation the deeper.
His poverty was due to his weakness. Virginia was especially
drawn toward him by reason of his inalienable
politeness and his well-chosen words. He was always
the gentleman&mdash;no matter how frayed his clothing.</p>
<p>So far as the younger men were concerned, she saw
little to admire and much to hate. They were crude and
uninteresting rowdies for the most part. She was put
upon her defence by their glances, and she came to dread
walking along the street, so open and coarse were their
words of praise. She felt dishonored by the glances
which her feet drew after her, and she always walked
swiftly to and from the store or the post-office.</p>
<p>Few of these loafers had the courage to stand on their
feet and court her favor, but there was one who speedily
became her chief persecutor. This was Neill Ballard,
celebrated (and made impudent) by two years&#8217; travel
with a Wild West show. He was tall, lean, angular, and
freckled, but his horsemanship was marvellous and his
skill with the rope magical. His special glory consisted
in a complicated whirling of the lariat. In his hand the
limp, inert cord took on life, grace, charm. It hung in
the air or ran in rhythmic waves about him, rising, falling,
expanding, diminishing, as if controlled by some
agency other than a man&#8217;s hand, and its gyrations had
won much applause in the Eastern cities, where such
skill is expected of the cowboys.</p>
<p>He had lost his engagement by reason of a drunken
brawl, and he was now living with his sister, the wife of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
a small rancher near by. He was vain, lazy, and unspeakably
corrupt, full of open boasting of his exploits in
the drinking-dens of the East. No sooner did he fix
eyes upon Virginia than he marked her for his special
prey. He had the depraved heart of the herder and
the insolent confidence of the hoodlum, and something
of this the girl perceived. She despised the other men,
but she feared this one, and quite justly, for he was
capable of assaulting and binding her with his rope,
as he had once done with a Shoshone squaw.</p>
<p>The Greggs, father and son, were in open rivalry for
Lee also, but in different ways. The older man, who had
already been married several times, was disposed to buy
her hand in what he called &#8220;honorable wedlock,&#8221; but
the son, at heart a libertine, approached her as one who
despised the West, and who, being kept in the beastly
country by duty to a parent, was ready to amuse himself
at any one&#8217;s expense. He had no purpose in life but to
feed his body and escape toil.</p>
<p>There are women to whom all this warfare would have
been diverting, but it was not so to Lee. Her sense of
responsibility was too keen. It was both a torture and a
shame. The chivalry of the plains, of which she had
read so much&mdash;and which she supposed she remembered&mdash;was
gone. She doubted if it had ever existed among
these centaurs. Why should it inhere in ignorant, brutal
plainsmen any more than in ignorant, brutal factory
hands?</p>
<p>There came to her, now and again, gentle old ranchers&mdash;&#8220;grangers,&#8221;
they would be called&mdash;and shy boys from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
the farms, but for the most part the men she saw embittered
her, and she kept out of their sight as much as
possible. Her keenest pleasures, almost her only pleasures,
lay in the occasional brief visits of the ranger, as he
rode in for his mail.</p>
<p>Lize perceived all these attacks on her daughter, and
was infuriated by them. She snapped and snarled like
a tigress leading her half-grown kitten through a throng
of leopards. Her brows were knotted with care as well
as with pain, and she incessantly urged Virginia to go
back to Sulphur. &#8220;I&#8217;ll send you money to pay your
board till you strike a job.&#8221; But to this the girl would
not agree; and the business, by reason of her presence,
went on increasing from day to day.</p>
<p>To Redfield Lize one day confessed her pain. &#8220;I
ought to send for that doctor up there, but the plain
truth is I&#8217;m afraid of him. I don&#8217;t want to know what&#8217;s
the matter of me. It&#8217;s his job to tell me I&#8217;m sick and
I&#8217;m scared of his verdict.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; he replied; &#8220;you can&#8217;t afford to put off
getting him much longer. I&#8217;m going back to-night, but
I&#8217;ll be over again to-morrow. Why don&#8217;t you let me bring
him down? It will save you twelve dollars. And, by the
way, suppose you let me take Lee Virginia home with me?
She looks a bit depressed; an outing will do her good.
She&#8217;s taken hold here wonderfully.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t she! But I should have sent her away the
very first night. I&#8217;m getting to depend on her. I&#8217;m
plumb foolish about her now&mdash;can&#8217;t let her out of my
sight; and yet I&#8217;m off my feed worryin&#8217; over her. Gregg
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
is getting dangerous&mdash;you can&#8217;t fool me when it comes to
men. Curse &#8217;em, they&#8217;re all alike&mdash;beasts, every cussed
one of them. I won&#8217;t have my girl mistreated, I tell you
that! I&#8217;m not fit to be her mother, now that&#8217;s the God&#8217;s
truth, Reddy, and this rotten little back-country cow-town
is no place for her. But what can I do? She won&#8217;t
leave me so long as I&#8217;m sick, and every day ties her closer
to me. I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;d do without her. If I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; to die I want her by me when I take my drop. So
you see just how I&#8217;m placed.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked yellow and drawn as she ended, and Redfield
was moved by her unwonted tenderness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now let me advise,&#8221; he began, after a moment&#8217;s
pause. &#8220;We musn&#8217;t let the girl get homesick. I&#8217;ll take
her home with me this afternoon, and bring her back
along with a doctor to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, but before you go I want to have a private
talk&mdash;I want to tell you something.&#8221;</p>
<p>He warned her away from what promised to be a confession.
&#8220;Now, now, Eliza, don&#8217;t tell me anything that
requires that tone of voice; I&#8217;m a bad person to keep a
secret, and you might be sorry for it. I don&#8217;t want
to know anything more about your business than I can
guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean the whiskey trade,&#8221; she explained.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve cut that all out anyway. It&#8217;s something more important&mdash;it&#8217;s
about Ed and me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to hear <i>that</i> either,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Let
bygones be bygones. What you did then is outlawed,
anyway. Those were fierce times, and I want to forget
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
them.&#8221; He looked about. &#8220;Let me see this Miss
Virginia and convey to her Mrs. Redfield&#8217;s invitation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s in the kitchen, I reckon. Go right out.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was rather glad of a chance to see the young reformer
in action, and smiled as he came upon her surrounded
by waiters and cooks, busily superintending
the preparations for the noon meal, which amounted to
a tumult each day.</p>
<p>She saw Redfield, nodded, and a few moments later
came toward him, flushed and beaming with welcome.
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you again, Mr. Supervisor.&#8221;</p>
<p>He bowed profoundly. &#8220;I&#8217;m delighted to find you
well, Miss Virginia, and doubly pleased to see you in
your regimentals, which you mightily adorn.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked down at her apron. &#8220;I made this myself.
Do you know our business is increasing wonderfully?
I&#8217;m busy every moment of the day till bedtime.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I do know it. I hear of the Wetherford
House all up and down the line. I was just telling your
mother she&#8217;ll be forced to build bigger, like the chap
in the Bible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She works too hard. Poor mother! I try to get her
to turn the cash-drawer over to me, but she won&#8217;t do
it. Doesn&#8217;t she seem paler and weaker to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She does, indeed, and this is what I came in to propose.
Mrs. Redfield sends by me a formal invitation
to you to visit Elk Lodge. She is not quite able to take
the long ride, else she&#8217;d come to you.&#8221; Here he handed
her a note. &#8220;I suggest that you go up with me this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
afternoon, and to-morrow we&#8217;ll fetch the doctor down
to see your mother. What do you say to that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes were dewy with grateful appreciation of his
kindness as she answered: &#8220;That would be a great
pleasure, Mr. Redfield, if mother feels able to spare me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve talked with her; she is anxious to have you go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia was indeed greatly pleased and pleasantly
excited by this message, for she had heard much of Mrs.
Redfield&#8217;s exclusiveness, and also of the splendor of her
establishment. She hurried away to dress with such
flutter of joyous anticipation that Redfield felt quite repaid
for the pressure he had put upon his wife to induce
her to write that note. &#8220;You may leave Lize Wetherford
out of the count, my dear,&#8221; he had said. &#8220;There
is nothing of her discernible in the girl. Virginia is a
lady. I don&#8217;t know where she got it, but she&#8217;s a gentlewoman
by nature.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lize said: &#8220;Don&#8217;t you figure on me in any way, Reddy.
I&#8217;m nothing but the old hen that raised up this lark,
and all I&#8217;m a-livin&#8217; for now is to make her happy. Just
you cut me out when it comes to any question about
your wife and Virginia. I&#8217;m not in their class.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was hot and still in the town, but no sooner was
the car in motion than both heat and dust were forgotten.
Redfield&#8217;s machine was not large, and as he was content
to go at moderate speed, conversation was possible.</p>
<p>He was of that sunny, optimistic, ever-youthful nature
which finds delight in human companionship under any
conditions whatsoever. He accepted this girl for what
she seemed&mdash;a fresh, unspoiled child. He saw nothing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
cheap or commonplace in her, and was not disposed to
impose any of her father&#8217;s wild doings upon her calendar.
He had his misgivings as to her future&mdash;that was the
main reason why he had said to Mrs. Redfield, &#8220;The girl
must be helped.&#8221; Afterward he had said &#8220;sustained.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was inevitable that the girl should soon refer to the
ranger, and Redfield was as complimentary of him as
she could wish. &#8220;Ross hasn&#8217;t a fault but one, and that&#8217;s
a negative one: he doesn&#8217;t care a hang about getting on,
as they say over in England. He&#8217;s content just to
do the duty of the moment. He made a good cow-puncher
and a good soldier; but as for promotion, he
laughs when I mention it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He told me that he hoped to be Chief Forester,&#8221;
protested Virginia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes, he says that; but do you know, he&#8217;d rather be
where he is, riding over the hills, than live in London.
You should see his cabin some time. It&#8217;s most wonderful,
really. His walls are covered with bookshelves of
his own manufacture, and chairs of his own design.
Where the boy got the skill, I don&#8217;t see. Heaven knows,
his sisters are conventional enough! He&#8217;s capable of
being Supervisor, but he won&#8217;t live in town and work
in an office. He&#8217;s like an Indian in his love of the
open.&#8221;</p>
<p>All this was quite too absorbingly interesting to permit
of any study of the landscape, which went by as if dismissed
by the chariot wheels of some contemptuous
magician. Redfield&#8217;s eyes were mostly on the road (in
the manner of the careful driver), but when he did look up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
it was to admire the color and poise of his seat-mate,
who made the landscape of small account.</p>
<p>She kept the conversation to the desired point. &#8220;Mr.
Cavanagh&#8217;s work interests me very much. It seems very
important; and it must be new, for I never heard of a
forest ranger when I was a child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The forester is new&mdash;at least, in America,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;My dear young lady, you are returned just in the
most momentous period in the history of the West.
The old dominion&mdash;the cattle-range&mdash;is passing. The
supremacy of the cowboy is ended. The cow-boss is
raising oats, the cowboy is pitching alfalfa, and swearing
horribly as he blisters his hands. Some of the rangers
at the moment are men of Western training like Ross,
but whose allegiance is now to Uncle Sam. With others
that transfer of allegiance is not quite complete, hence
the insolence of men like Gregg, who think they can
bribe or intimidate these forest guards, and so obtain
favors; the newer men are college-bred, real foresters.
But you can&#8217;t know what it all means till you see Ross,
or some other ranger, on his own heath. We&#8217;ll make
up a little party some day and drop down upon him, and
have him show us about. It&#8217;s a lonely life, and so the
ranger keeps open house. Would you like to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes indeed! I&#8217;m eager to get into the mountains.
Every night as I see the sun go down over them
I wonder what the world is like up there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he began very delicately to inquire about her
Eastern experience. There was not much to tell. In a
lovely old town not far from Philadelphia, where her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
aunt lived, she had spent ten years of happy exile. &#8220;I
was horribly lonely and homesick at first,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Mother wrote only short letters, and my father never
wrote at all. I didn&#8217;t know he was dead then. He
was always good to me. He wasn&#8217;t a bad man, was
he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; responded Redfield, without hesitation. &#8220;He
was very like the rest of us&mdash;only a little more reckless
and a little more partisan, that&#8217;s all. He was a dashing
horseman and a dead-shot, and so, naturally, a leader
of these daredevils. He was popular with both sides
of the controversy up to the very moment when he went
South to lead the invaders against the rustlers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was it all about? I never understood it. What
were they fighting about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a sense, it was all very simple. You see, Uncle
Sam, in his careless, do-nothing way, has always left his
range to whomever got there first, and that was the
cattle-man. At first there was grass enough for us all,
but as we built sheds and corrals about watering-places
we came to claim <i>rights</i> on the range. We usually secured
by fraud homesteads in the sections containing
water, and so, gun in hand, &#8216;stood off&#8217; the man who
came after. Gradually, after much shooting and lawing,
we parcelled out the range and settled down covering
practically the whole State. Our adjustments were
not perfect, but our system was working smoothly for us
who controlled the range. We had convinced ourselves,
and pretty nearly everybody else, that the State
was only fit for cattle-grazing, and that we were the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
most competent grazers; furthermore, we were in
possession, and no man could come in without our
consent.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, a very curious law of our own making was
our undoing. Of course the &#8216;nester&#8217; or &#8216;punkin roller,&#8217;
as we contemptuously called the small farmer, began
sifting in here and there in spite of our guns, but he was
only a mosquito bite in comparison with the trouble
which our cow-punchers stirred up. Perhaps you remember
enough about the business to know that an unbranded
yearling calf without its mother is called a
maverick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I remember that. It belongs to the man who
finds him, and brands him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Precisely. Now that law worked very nicely so long
as the poor cowboy was willing to catch and brand him
for his employer, but it proved a &#8216;joker&#8217; when he woke
up and said to his fellows: &#8216;Why brand these mavericks
at five dollars per head for this or that outfit
when the law says it belongs to the man who finds
him?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee Virginia looked up brightly. &#8220;That seems right
to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah yes; but wait. We cattle-men had large herds,
and the <i>probabilities</i> were that the calf belonged to some
one of us; whereas, the cowboy, having no herd at all,
<i>knew</i> the maverick belonged to some one&#8217;s herd. True,
the law said it was his, but the law did not mean to reward
the freebooter; yet that is exactly what it did.
At first only a few outlaws took advantage of it; but hard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
years came on, the cattle business became less and less
profitable, we were forced to lay off our men, and so at
last the range swarmed with idle cow-punchers; then
came the breakdown in our scheme! The cowboys took
to &#8216;mavericking&#8217; on their own account. Some of them
had the grace to go into partnership with some farmer,
and so claim a small bunch of cows, but others suddenly
and miraculously acquired herds of their own. From
keeping within the law, they passed to violent methods.
They slit the tongues of calves for the purpose of separating
them from their mothers. Finding he could not
suck, bossy would at last wander away from his dam,
and so become a &#8216;maverick.&#8217; In short, anarchy reigned
on the range.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But surely my father had nothing to do with
this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; your father, up to this time, had been on good
terms with everybody. He had a small herd of cattle
down the river, which he owned in common with a man
named Hart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was well thought of by all the big outfits; and
when the situation became intolerable, and we got together
to weed out &#8216;the rustlers,&#8217; as these cattle-thieves
were called, your father was approached and converted
to a belief in drastic measures. He had suffered less
than the rest of us because of his small herd and the
fact that he was very popular among the cowboys. So
far as I was concerned, the use of violent methods revolted
me. My training in the East had made me a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
respecter of the law. &#8216;Change the law,&#8217; I said. &#8216;The
law is all right,&#8217; they replied; &#8216;the trouble is with these
rustlers. We&#8217;ll hang a few of &#8217;em, and that will break
up the business.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Parts of this story came back to the girl&#8217;s mind, producing
momentary flashes of perfect recollection. She
heard again the voices of excited men arguing over and
over the question of &#8220;mavericking,&#8221; and she saw her
father as he rode up to the house that last day before
he went South.</p>
<p>Redfield went on. &#8220;The whole plan as developed
was silly, and I wonder still that Ed Wetherford, who
knew &#8216;the nester&#8217; and the cowboy so well, should have
lent his aid to it. The cattle-men&mdash;some from Cheyenne,
some from Denver, and a few from New York and
Chicago&mdash;agreed to finance a sort of Vigilante Corps
composed of men from the outside, on the understanding
that this policing body should be commanded by
one of their own number. Your father was chosen second
in command, and was to guide the party; for he knew
almost every one of the rustlers, and could ride directly
to their doors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish he hadn&#8217;t done that,&#8221; murmured the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must be frank with you, Virginia. I can&#8217;t excuse
that in him. It was a kind of treachery. He must
have been warped by his associates. They convinced
him by some means that it was his duty, and one fine
day the Fork was startled by a messenger, who rode in
to say that the cattle-barons were coming with a hundred
Texas bad men &#8216;to clean out the town,&#8217; and to put their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
own men into office. This last was silly rot to me, but
the people believed it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl was tingling now. &#8220;I remember! I remember
the men who rode into the town to give the alarm.
Their horses were white with foam; their heads hung
down, and their sides went in and out. I pitied the poor
things. Mother jumped on her pony, and rode out
among the men. She wanted to go with them, but they
wouldn&#8217;t let her. I was scared almost breathless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was in Sulphur City, and did not hear of it till it was
nearly all over,&#8221; Redfield resumed, his speech showing a
little of the excitement which thrilled through the girl&#8217;s
voice. &#8220;Well, the first act of vengeance was so ill-considered
that it practically ended the whole campaign.
The invaders fell upon and killed two ranchers&mdash;one
of whom was probably not a rustler at all, but a peaceable
settler, and the other one they most barbarously hanged.
More than this, they attacked and vainly tried to kill
two settlers whom they met on the road&mdash;German farmers,
with no connection, so far as known, with the thieves.
These men escaped, and gave the alarm. In a few hours
the whole range was aflame with vengeful fire. The
Forks, as you may recall, was like a swarm of bumblebees.
Every man and boy was armed and mounted. The
storekeepers distributed guns and ammunition, leaders
developed, and the embattled &#8216;punkin rollers,&#8217; rustlers,
and townsmen rode out to meet the invaders.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl paled with memory of it. &#8220;It was terrible!
I went all day without eating, and for two nights we
were all too excited to sleep. It seemed as if the world
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
were coming to an end. Mother cried because they
wouldn&#8217;t let her go with them. She didn&#8217;t know father
was leading the other army.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She must have known soon, for it was reported that
your father was among them. She certainly knew when
they were driven to earth in that log fort, for they were
obliged to restrain her by force from going to your father.
As I run over those furious days it all seems incredible,
like a sudden reversal to barbarism.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did it all end? The soldiers came, didn&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; the long arm of Uncle Sam reached out and took
hold upon the necks of both parties. I guess your father
and his band would have died right there had not the
regular army interfered. It only required a sergeant
wearing Uncle Sam&#8217;s uniform to come among those
armed and furious cowboys and remove their prisoners.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw that. It was very strange&mdash;that sergeant was
so young and so brave.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned and smiled at her. &#8220;Do you know who that
was?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes flashed. She drew her breath with a gasp.
&#8220;Was it Mr. Cavanagh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it was Ross. He was serving in the regular
army at the time. He has told me since that he felt no
fear whatever. &#8216;Uncle Sam&#8217;s blue coat was like Siegfried&#8217;s
magic armor,&#8217; he said; &#8216;it was the kind of thing
the mounted police of Canada had been called upon to
do many a time, and I went in and got my men.&#8217; That
ended the war, so far as violent measures went, and it
really ended the sovereignty of the cattle-man. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
power of the &#8216;nester&#8217; has steadily increased from that
moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But my father&mdash;what became of him? They took
him away to the East, and that is all I ever knew. What
do you think became of him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could never make up my mind. All sorts of rumors
come to us concerning him. As a matter of fact, the
State authorities sympathized with the cattle-barons, and
my own opinion is that your father was permitted to
escape. He was afterward seen in Texas, and later it
was reported that he had been killed there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl sat still, listening to the tireless whir of the
machine, and looking out at the purpling range with
tear-mist eyes. At last she said: &#8220;I shall never think
of my father as a bad man, he was always so gentle to
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You need not condemn him, my dear young lady.
First of all, it&#8217;s not fair to bring him (as he was in those
days) forward into these piping times of dairy cows and
alfalfa. The people of the Forks&mdash;some of them, at
least&mdash;consider him a traitor, and regard you as the
daughter of a renegade, but what does it matter? Each
year sees the Old West diminish, and already, in the work
of the Forest Service, law and order advance. Notwithstanding
all the shouting of herders and the beating to
death of sheep, no hostile shot has ever been fired within
the bounds of a National Forest. In the work of the
forest rangers lies the hope of ultimate peace and order
over all the public lands.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl fell silent again, her mind filled with larger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
conceptions of life than her judgment had hitherto been
called upon to meet. She knew that Redfield was right,
and yet that world of the past&mdash;the world of the swift
herdsman and his trampling, long-horned, half-wild kine
still appealed to her imagination. The West of her girlhood
seemed heroic in memory; even the quiet account
of it to which she had just listened could not conceal
its epic largeness of movement. The part which troubled
her most was her father&#8217;s treachery to his neighbors.
That he should fight, that he should kill men in honorable
warfare, she could understand; but not his recreancy,
his desertion of her mother and herself.</p>
<p>She came back to dwell at last on the action of that
slim young soldier who had calmly ridden through the
infuriated mob. She remembered that she had thrilled
even then at the vague and impersonal power which he
represented. To her childish mind he seemed to bear
a charm, like the heroes of her story-books&mdash;something
which made him invulnerable.</p>
<p>After a long pause Redfield spoke again. &#8220;The memory
of your father will make life for a time a bit hard for
you in Roaring Fork&mdash;perhaps your mother&#8217;s advice is
sound. Why not come to Sulphur City, which is almost
entirely of the new spirit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I can get my mother to come, too, I will be glad
to do so, for I hate the Fork; but I will not leave her
there, sick and alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Much depends upon the doctor&#8217;s examination to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had topped the divide now between the Fork
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
and Sulphur Creek Basin, and the green fields, the alfalfa
meadows, and the painted farm-houses thickened beneath
them. Strange how significant all these signs
were now. A few days ago they had appeared doubtful
improvements, now they represented the oncoming
dominion of the East. They meant cleanliness and
decent speech, good bread and sweet butter. Ultimately
houses with hot water in their bath-rooms and
pianos in their parlors would displace the shack, the
hitching-pole, and the dog-run, and in those days Edward
Wetherford would be forgotten.</p>
<p>Redfield swept through the town, then turned up the
stream directly toward the high wall of the range, which
was ragged and abrupt at this point. They passed several
charming farm-houses, and the western sky grew
ever more glorious with its plum-color and saffron, and
the range reasserted its mastery over the girl. At last
they came to the very jaws of the canon; and there, in
a deep natural grove of lofty cottonwood-trees, Redfield
passed before a high rustic gate which marked the beginning
of his estate. The driveway was of gravel, and
the intermingling of transplanted shrubs and pine-trees
showed the care of the professional gardener.</p>
<p>The house was far from being a castle; indeed, it was
very like a house in Bryn-Mawr, except that it was built
entirely of half-hewn logs, with a wide projecting roof.
Giant hydrangeas and other flowering shrubs bordered
the drive, and on the rustic terrace a lady in white was
waiting.</p>
<p>Redfield slowed down, and scrambled ungracefully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
out; but his voice was charming as he said: &#8220;Eleanor,
this it Miss Wetherford. She was on the point of getting
the blues, so I brought her away,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>Mrs. Redfield, quite as urban as the house, was a
slim little woman of delicate habit, very far from the
ordinary conception of a rancher&#8217;s wife. Her manner
was politely considerate, but not heatedly cordial (the
visitor was not precisely hers), and though she warmed a
little after looking into Virginia&#8217;s face, she could not by
any stretch of phrase be called cordial.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you tired? would you like to lie down before
dinner?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no, indeed. Nothing ever tires me,&#8221; Virginia
responded, with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look like one in perfect health,&#8221; continued her
hostess, in the envious tone of one who knew all too well
what ill-health meant. &#8220;Let me show you to your room.&#8221;</p>
<p>The house was not precisely the palace the cowboy
had reported it to be, but it was charmingly decorated,
and the furnishings were tasteful. To the girl it was as
if she had been transported with instant magic from the
horrible little cow-town back to the home of one of her
dearest friends in Chester. She was at once exalted and
humbly grateful.</p>
<p>&#8220;We dine at seven,&#8221; Mrs. Redfield was saying, &#8220;so
you can take a cup of tea without spoiling your dinner.
Will you venture it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well; come down soon, and I&#8217;ll have it ready.
Mr. Redfield, I&#8217;m sure, will want some.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>Virginia&#8217;s heart was dancing with delight of this home
as she came down the stairs a little later. She found Mr.
Redfield at the farther end of a long sitting-room, whose
dim light was as restful (after the glare of the tawny
plains) as the voice of her hostess was to her ears, which
still ached with the noise of profane and vulgar speech.</p>
<p>Redfield heard her coming and met her half-way, and
with stately ceremony showed her a seat. &#8220;I fear you
will need something stronger than tea after my exhausting
conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope, Hugh, you were not in one of your talking
moods?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was, Eleanor. I talked incessantly, barring an
occasional jolt of the machine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You poor thing!&#8221; This to Virginia. &#8220;Truly you
deserve a two hours&#8217; rest before dinner, for our dinner
is always a talk-fest, and to-night, with Senator
Bridges here, it will be a convention.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned to Virginia. &#8220;We were talking old times
&#8216;before the war,&#8217; and you know it never tires veterans to
run over their ancient campaigns&mdash;does it, Lee Virginia?&#8221;</p>
<p>As they talked Mrs. Redfield studied the girl with increasing
interest and favor, and soon got at her point of
view. She even secured a little more of her story, which
matched fairly well with the account her husband had
given. Her prejudices were swept away, and she treated
her young guest as one well-born and well-educated
woman treats another.</p>
<p>At last she said: &#8220;We dress for dinner, but any frock
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
you have will do. We are not ironclad in our rules.
There will be some neighbors in, but it isn&#8217;t in any sense
a &#8216;party.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee Virginia went to her room, borne high upon a new
conception of the possibilities of the West. It was
glorious to think that one could enjoy the refinement,
the comfort of the East at the same time that one dwelt
within the inspiring shadow of the range. She caught
some prophetic hint in all this of the future age when
each of these foot-hills would be peopled by those to
whom cleanliness of mind and grace of body were habitual.
Standing on the little balcony which filled the front of her
windows, she looked away at the towering heights,
smoky purple against a sky of burning gold, and her
eyes expanded like those of the young eagle when about
to launch himself upon the sunset wind.</p>
<p>The roar of a waterfall came to her ears, and afar on
the sage-green carpet of the lower mesa a horseman was
galloping swiftly. Far to the left of this smoothly
sculptured table-land a band of cattle fed, while under
her eyes, formal as a suburban home, lay a garden of
old-fashioned English flowers. It was a singular and
moving union of the old and new&mdash;the East and the West.</p>
<p>On her table and on the pretty bookshelves she found
several of the latest volumes of poetry and essays, and
the bed, with its dainty covering and ample spread,
testified quite as plainly of taste and comfort. Her
hands were a-tremble as she put on the bright muslin
gown which was all she had for evening wear. She
felt very much like the school-girl again, and after she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
had done her best to look nice, she took a seat in the
little rocker, with intent to compose herself for her meeting
with strangers. &#8220;I wish we were dining without
visitors,&#8221; she said, as she heard a carriage drive up. A
little later a galloping horse entered the yard and stopped
at the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;It all sounds like a play,&#8221; she said to herself,
forgetting for the moment that she was miles away from
a town and in a lonely ranch-house under the very
shadows of the mountains.</p>
<p>She heard voices in the hall, and among them one with
a very English accent&mdash;one that sounded precisely like
those she had heard on the stage. It was the voice of a
man, big, hearty, with that thick, throaty gurgle which
is so suggestive of London that one is certain to find
a tweed suit and riding-breeches associated with it.</p>
<p>At last she dared wait no longer, and taking courage
from necessity, descended the stairs&mdash;a pleasant picture
of vigorous yet somewhat subdued maidenhood.</p>

<h3>TWO ON THE VERANDA</h3>
</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Redfield</span> met his young guest in dinner-coat, looking
extremely urban, and presented his &#8220;friend and neighbor,
Mr. Enderby.&#8221;</p>
<p>Enderby turned out to be the owner of the voice with
the English accent which Lee Virginia had heard in the
hall, but he was very nice, and a moment later Mrs.
Redfield entered with Mrs. Enderby, a large lady with
a smiling face. Then a voice she knew spoke from behind
her: &#8220;I don&#8217;t need a presentation. Miss Wetherford and
I have already met.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned to meet Ross Cavanagh, the young ranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you get here?&#8221; she asked, in wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;I rode across the hills; it&#8217;s not far.&#8221;</p>
<p>He too was in evening dress, and as she stared at him
in surprise he laughingly protested. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t scrutinize
this coat too closely. It&#8217;s the only one I&#8217;ve owned
for ten years, and this is the only house in which I&#8217;d
<i>dare</i> to wear it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bridges (who turned out to be a State senator) was a
farmer-like elderly man wearing a badly fitting serge
suit. He was markedly Western; so was his wife, who
looked rather uneasy and hot.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>It was all delightfully exciting to Lee Virginia, and
to be taken in to dinner by the transfigured ranger
completed her appreciation of the charming home and
its refined hostess.</p>
<p>Redfield shone as host, presenting an admirable
mixture of clubman and Western rancher. His natural
sense of humor, sharpened by twenty years of plains life,
was Western. His manner, his habits of dress, of dining,
of taking wine, were uncorruptedly Manhattan. Enderby,
large, high-colored, was naturally a bit of what we
know as the &#8220;haw-haw type&#8221; of Englishman&mdash;a thoroughly
good fellow, kindly, tolerant, brave, and generous,
who could not possibly change his spots. He had failed
utterly to acquire the American idiom, and his attempts
at cowboy slang were often amusing&mdash;especially to Redfield,
who prided himself on being quite undistinguishable
in a cow-camp.</p>
<p>Virginia and Ross, being the only young folk at the
table, were seated together, and Enderby remarked
privately: &#8220;Ross, you&#8217;re in luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I am,&#8221; he replied, heartily.</p>
<p>He was (as Redfield had said) highly susceptible,
made so by his solitary life in the mountains, and to be
seated close beside this maid of the valley stirred his
blood to the danger-point. It was only by an effort
of the will that he kept in touch with Redfield&#8217;s remarks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enderby never can grow accustomed to his democratic
neighbors,&#8221; Redfield was saying. &#8220;He&#8217;s been here
six years, and yet when one of his cowboy friends tells
him to &#8216;go to hell&#8217; he&#8217;s surprised and a bit offended.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it isn&#8217;t that,&#8221; explained Mrs. Enderby; &#8220;it&#8217;s
to have your maids say &#8216;All right&#8217; when you ask them
to remove the soup. It&#8217;s a bit shocking also to have
your cook or housemaid going about the house singing
some wretched ditty. What was that one, Charley,
that Irma Maud sang till we were nearly wild (Irma
Maud was my chambermaid). What was it? Something
about &#8216;Tixey Ann.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know it perfectly!&#8221; exclaimed Enderby. &#8220;&#8216;If
you want to make a niggah feel good&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no; that&#8217;s another one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Redfield interposed. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t have them go
about in sullen stealth, would you? Think how song
lightens their drudgery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah yes; but if it drives the family out-of-doors?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It shouldn&#8217;t. You should take it all as a part of the
happy world of democracy wherein even the maid-servant
sings at her toil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But our democratic neighbors are all the time coming
to look round the place. We&#8217;ve no privacy whatever.
On Sunday afternoon they drive through the
grounds in procession; you&#8217;d think our place a public
park and we the keepers.&#8221;</p>
<p>In all this banter Virginia was given the English
viewpoint as to Western manners and conditions. She
perceived that the Enderbys, notwithstanding their
heavy-set prejudices, were persons of discernment and
right feeling. It certainly was impertinent of the neighbors
to ride through the grounds as if they were public,
and Mrs. Enderby was justified in resenting it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></p>
<p>Ross turned to her. &#8220;Enderby is the kind of Englishman
who wants to adapt himself to new conditions,
but can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem like an Englishman at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I was caught young, and, besides, I&#8217;m really
Irish&mdash;on my father&#8217;s side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s different!&#8221; she exclaimed, as though that
somehow brought him nearer to her own people.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he laughingly agreed. &#8220;But Enderby&mdash;I
suppose his pedigree goes back to Cedric and his
swineherds. You can&#8217;t change that kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t the least thought of seeing you here. How
did you happen to come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Redfield telephoned me at the mill, and I came at
once. I haven&#8217;t been here since May, and I just thought
I&#8217;d take a half a day off. Luckily, my understudy was
with me. I left him &#8216;on the job.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not tell her that she was the principal reason
for this sudden descent upon Elk Lodge, and no one but
Redfield knew the killing ride he had taken in order to
be in at the beginning of the dinner. The girl&#8217;s face and
voice, especially her voice, had been with him night and
day as he went about his solitary duties. Her life problem
had come to fill his mind to a disturbing degree, and
he was eager to know more of her and of her struggle
against the vice and vulgarity of the Forks.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is your mother?&#8221; he asked, a few minutes
later.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all well. Mr. Redfield is to take the doctor
back with us to-morrow.&#8221; The ecstasy died out of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
face, and the flexible lips drooped with troubled musing.
&#8220;I am afraid she suffers more than she will admit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She needs a rest and change. She should get away
from her seat at that cash-register, and return to the
open air. A touch of camp-life would help her. She
sticks too close to her work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know she does, but she won&#8217;t let me relieve her,
even for an hour. It isn&#8217;t because she doesn&#8217;t trust
me; she says it&#8217;s because she doesn&#8217;t want me sitting
there&mdash;so&mdash;publicly. She doesn&#8217;t oppose my housekeeping
any more&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly have made the old hotel into a place of
miraculous neatness.&#8221;</p>
<p>She flushed with pleasure. &#8220;I have done something,
but not as I&#8217;d like to do. I really think if mother wishes
to sell she could do so now to much better advantage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no doubt of it. Really, I&#8217;m not being funny,
Miss Wetherford, when I say you&#8217;ve done something
heroic. It&#8217;s no easy thing to come into a place like that
and make it habitable. It shows immense courage and
self-reliance on your part. It&#8217;s precisely the kind of
work this whole country needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>His praise, sincere and generous, repaid her for all
she had gone through. It was a great pleasure to hear
her small self praised for courage and self-reliance by
one whose daily work was heroic. All things conspired
to make a conquest of her heart, for the ranger bore
himself with grace, and dealt with his silver deftly. His
face, seen from the side, was older and sterner than
she had thought it, but it was very attractive in line.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>She said: &#8220;Mr. Redfield and I were talking of &#8216;the
war&#8217; to-day&mdash;I mean our &#8216;cattle-man&#8217;s invasion&#8217;&mdash;and I
learned that you were the sergeant who came for the
prisoners.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled. &#8220;Yes; I was serving in the regular army
at that time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have been very young?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was&mdash;a kid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a brave thing to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all. I was a soldier under orders of the commander
of the post. I dared not disobey.&#8221;</p>
<p>She would not have it so. &#8220;But you knew that you
were going into danger?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be honest about it, I did; but I relied on my
blue coat to protect me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a terrible time. I was only a child, but I
can remember how wild the men all seemed when you
drove up and leaped out of the wagon. I didn&#8217;t realize
that my father&#8217;s life depended on your coming, but we
all knew it was brave of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I was born a soldier. What I like about my
present job is its definiteness. I have my written instructions,
and there&#8217;s no need to argue anything. I
carry out my orders. But I beg pardon, I&#8217;m not going
to talk &#8216;shop&#8217; to you. I want you to tell me about yourself.
I hope you are not to return to the East, for
if you do not I shall be able to see you occasionally.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here Redfield appealed to the ranger. &#8220;Ross, you&#8217;re
all sorts of a reactionary. What do you say to this?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
Senator Bridges is opposed to all Federal interference
with State forests and State game.&#8221;</p>
<p>The forester&#8217;s eyes lit up. &#8220;But are they State
forests and State game? What makes them so? They
are lands which the whole people purchased and which
the whole people defended.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heah! heah!&#8221; cheered Enderby.</p>
<p>Bridges bristled with anger, and went off into a long
harangue on States rights and the dangers of centralization,
to which Enderby replied: &#8220;Bosh! the whole
trouble with your bally Government is its lack of cohesion.
If I had my way, I&#8217;d wipe out the Senate and put a strong
man like Roosevelt at the head of the executive. You&#8217;re
such blooming asses over here; you don&#8217;t know enough
to keep a really big man in your presidential chair.
This fussing about every four years to put in some oily
corporation lawyer is bloody rot. Here&#8217;s Roosevelt gets
in the midst of a lot of the finest kind of reforms, y&#8217; know,
and directly you go and turn him out! Then if you get
a bad man, you&#8217;ve to wait four years till you can fetch him
a whack. Why not arrange it so you can pitch your
President out the minute he goes wrong? I say your
old rag of a Constitution is a ball-and-chain on your
national leg. England is immeasurably better off so
far as that goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross turned to Virginia, leaving the political discussion
to go on over his head. &#8220;I was back in the Old Island a
couple of years ago, and you&#8217;ve no idea how small it
seemed to me. It surely is a &#8216;right little, tight little
island.&#8217; I couldn&#8217;t help wondering whether the men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
in Parliament were as important as they seemed to think
they were, and whether England is not really an empty
shell of empire, a memory of what it once was. I
couldn&#8217;t settle down there, someway. I was homesick
for the mountains in a month. But what scared me
most was the pauper population of the old place&mdash;one
in every thirty-seven must be helped. I came back to
the States gladly. &#8216;I guess I&#8217;m an American,&#8217; I said to
my sisters.&#8221;</p>
<p>To Lee Virginia all this talk of &#8220;the curse of democracy&#8221;
and &#8220;the decay of empire&#8221; was unexciting, but
when Cavanagh told of the sheepmen&#8217;s advance across
the dead-line on Deer Creek, and of the threats of the
cattle-owners, she was better able to follow the discussion.
Bridges was heartily on the side of law and order, for
he wished to boom the State (being a heavy owner in a
town-site), but he objected to Redfield&#8217;s ideas of &#8220;bottling
up the resources of the State.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not,&#8221; retorted Redfield; &#8220;we&#8217;re merely defending
them against those who would monopolize them.
We believe in their fullest use, but we see no reason for
giving away the resources when the country needs the
revenue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Redfield rose as soon as the coffee came on.
&#8220;You gentlemen seem bent upon discussing matters of no
interest to us,&#8221; she said, &#8220;so we&#8217;ll leave you to fight it
out alone. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll all agree with Hugh in the
end. Like General Grant, he&#8217;s a very obstinate man.&#8221;</p>
<p>No sooner were they seated in the big living-room than
Mrs. Enderby began to relate comical stories of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
household. Her cats had fits and ran up the wall. Her
dogs were forever getting quilled by reason of foolish
attacks upon porcupines, or else they came home so
reminiscent of skunks that they all but smothered the
cook. &#8220;Invariably they return from encounters of this
kind just as we are sitting at dinner,&#8221; she explained.
&#8220;Furthermore, Enderby&#8217;s ditches are habitually getting
clogged, and overflowing the lawn and filling the cellar,
and he stands in terror of his cowboys. When I think
of all these irruptions and distractions, England&#8217;s order
and routine seem heavenly; but Charley finds all this
amusing, more&#8217;s the pity, and leaves me to set things in
order. Most ludicrous of all, to me, is his habitual claim
that the ranch is paying. I tell him there&#8217;s an error in
his bookkeeping somewhere, but he assures me that his
receipts exceeded his expenditures last year&mdash;which is
quite too incredible. You&#8217;ve no idea how high wages
are and how little we raise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes, I have,&#8221; laughed Mrs. Redfield, &#8220;and my
cat had a fit too. Hugh says it&#8217;s the high altitude. I
tell him it&#8217;s melancholia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh showed himself. &#8220;I hear so much laughter
I&#8217;m coming in, we&#8217;re all so insufferably political out
here. And, besides, I came to see the ladies, and I can
only stay a few minutes longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going back to-night!&#8221; exclaimed his hostess.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must be on my own precinct by daylight,&#8221; he
replied; &#8220;the Supervisor has an eye on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Redfield explained to Lee Virginia. &#8220;He rode
fifty miles over the mountains&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty,&#8221; corrected Ross. &#8220;But what does that
matter when I&#8217;m in the company of such charming
ladies?&#8221; he added, gallantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now he&#8217;s going to ride all the way back to-night!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of that,&#8221; gasped Mrs. Enderby, &#8220;and no
moon!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you find your way?&#8221; asked Mrs. Bridges,
to whom this was a mortally dangersome journey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s quite simple. If you don&#8217;t bump against a
tree or fall into the creek you may be quite sure you&#8217;re
on the trail,&#8221; laughed Ross.</p>
<p>Mrs. Redfield knew the true reason for his coming,
and was not at all pleased, &#8220;for with all Lee&#8217;s personal
charm,&#8221; she said to her husband, &#8220;she is socially beneath
Ross Cavanagh, even in a State where social barriers are
few.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come out on the veranda,&#8221; suggested Cavanagh,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ll show you the hills I must climb.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee accepted innocently; but as the young people left
the room Mrs. Enderby looked at her hostess with
significant glance. &#8220;There&#8217;s the lady Ross rode down
to meet. Who is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her mother is that dreadful old creature that keeps
the Wetherford Hotel in Roaring Fork.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Enderby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; Lee Virginia is Lize Wetherford&#8217;s daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the girl is charming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot understand it. Hugh came home a week
or so ago full of her praise&mdash;&#8221; And at this point her voice
dropped lower and the other drew closer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>Outside, the young people stood in silence. There
was no moon, and the mountains rose darkly, a sheer
wall at the end of the garden, their tops cutting into the
starry sky with a dull edge, over which a dim white cone
peered.</p>
<p>&#8220;That snow-peak is Wolftooth, and thirty miles from
here, and at the head of my &#8216;beat,&#8217;&#8221; said the ranger,
after a pause, as they leaned against the railing and
looked away to the south. &#8220;I go up that ridge which
you see faintly at the left of the main canon, and through
that deep notch which is above timber-line.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s eyes widened with awe of the big, silent, dark
world he indicated. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you afraid to start out on
such a trip alone&mdash;I mean, don&#8217;t you dread it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be sorry to start back, yes, but not because of
the dark. I&#8217;ve enjoyed my visit here so much it will be
hard to say good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems strange to me that you should prefer this
wild country to England.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like the East better than the West?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In some ways; but then, you see, I was born out here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So was I&mdash;I mean to say I was regenerated out here.
The truth is I was a good deal of a scapegrace when I
left England. I was always for hunting and horses,
and naturally I came directly to the wild West country,
and here I&#8217;ve been ever since. I&#8217;ve had my turn at each
phase of it&mdash;cow-puncher, soldier, Rough-rider, and finally
forest ranger. I reckon I&#8217;ve found my job at last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like it so much?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At the present time I am perfectly contented. I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
associated now with a country that will never yield to
the plough&mdash;yes, I like my work. I love the forests and
the streams. I wish I might show them to you. You
don&#8217;t know how beautiful they are. The most beautiful
parks in the world are commonplace to what I can show
you. My only sorrow is to think of them given over
to the sawmill. Perhaps you and your mother will
come up some time, and let me show you my lakes and
streams. There are waters so lovely they make the
heart ache. Hugh is planning to come up soon; perhaps
you and Mrs. Redfield will come with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like it above everything,&#8221; she responded, fervently.
Then her voice changed: &#8220;But all depends on my
mother&#8217;s health.&#8221;</p>
<p>It hurt him to hear her call Eliza Wetherford mother.
He wanted to forget her origin for the moment. He was
not in love with her&mdash;far from it! But she was so alluring,
and the proprietress of the Wetherford House was
not nice, and that made one doubt the daughter.</p>
<p>She broke the silence. &#8220;It seems dreadfully dark and
mysterious up there.&#8221; She indicated his path.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t as bad as it looks. There is a good trail,
and my pony knows it as well as I do. I enjoy riding
by night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But there are bears and other wild things, are there
not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not as many as I wish there were.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you say that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate to see all the wild life killed off. Some day
all these forests will have game refuges like the Yellowstone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
National Park. They are coming each year to
have greater and greater value to the people of the plains.
They are playgrounds, like the Alps. Campers are
coming into my valley every day, and, while they increase
the danger of fires, I welcome them. They are all advocates
of the forest. As one man said: &#8216;The mountains
supplement the plains. They give color and charm to
the otherwise monotonous West.&#8217; I confess I couldn&#8217;t
live on the prairies&mdash;not even on the plains&mdash;if out of
sight of the mountains. If I should ever settle down to
a home it would be in a canon like this, with a great peak
at my front door.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> beautiful,&#8221; the girl said, in the tone of sadness
with which we confront the perfect night, the perfect
flower, the flawless landscape. &#8220;It is both grand and
peaceful.&#8221;</p>
<p>This tone of sadness pleased him. It showed her
depth of perception, and he reflected that she had not
uttered a vacuous or silly phrase since their first meeting.
&#8220;She is capable of great development,&#8221; he thought.
Aloud he said: &#8220;You are a strange mingling of East
and West. Do you realize it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221; she asked, feeling something ardent
in his tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;You typify to me at this moment this whole State.
You fill me with enthusiasm for its future. Here you
are, derived from the lawless West, yet taking on the
culture and restraint of the East so readily that you
seem not in the least related to&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He checked himself at this point, and she said:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
&#8220;My mother is not as rough as she seems, Mr. Cavanagh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She must be more of the woman than appears, or
she could not have borne such a daughter. But do you
feel your relationship to her? Tell me honestly, for you
interest me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t at first, but I do now. I begin to understand
her, and, besides, I feel in myself certain things
that are in her, though I think I am more like the Wetherfords.
My father&#8217;s family home was in Maryland.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross could have talked on all night, so alluring was
the girl&#8217;s dimly-seen yet warmly-felt figure at his side,
but a sense of danger and a knowledge that he should
be riding led him at last to say: &#8220;It is getting chill, we
must go in; but before we do so, let me say how much
I&#8217;ve enjoyed seeing you again. I hope the doctor will
make favorable report on your mother&#8217;s case. You&#8217;ll
write me the result of the examination, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you wish me to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be most anxious to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were standing very near to each other at the
moment, and the ranger, made very sensitive to woman&#8217;s
charm by his lonely life, shook with newly-created love
of her. A suspicion, a hope that beneath her cultivated
manner lay the passionate nature of her mother gave an
added force to his desire. He was sorely tempted
to touch her, to test her; but her sweet voice, a little sad
and perfectly unconscious of evil, calmed him. She said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope to persuade my mother to leave the Forks.
All the best people there are against us. Some of them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
have been very cruel to her and to me, and, besides, I
despise and fear the men who come to our table.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not exchange words with them,&#8221; he all
but commanded. &#8220;Beware of Gregg; he is a vile lot;
do not trust him for an instant. Do not permit any of
those loafers to talk with you, for if you do they will go
away to defame you. I know them. They are unspeakably
vile. It makes me angry to think that Gregg
and his like have the right to speak to you every day while
I can only see you at long intervals.&#8221;</p>
<p>His heat betrayed the sense of proprietorship which he
had begun to feel, in spite of his resolution. But the girl
only perceived his solicitation, his friendly interest, and
she answered: &#8220;I keep away from them all I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right to distrust them,&#8221; he replied, grimly.
&#8220;Because old Sam has money, he thinks he can do as he
pleases. You must be especially careful of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The worst is when I go on the street; but if mother
does not sell the business, I shall be obliged to stay in
the Fork, no matter how I hate it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish my station were not so far away,&#8221; he mused,
darkly. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll ride down as often as my duties will
permit, and you must let me know how things go. And if
any of those fellows persecute you, you&#8217;ll tell me, won&#8217;t
you? I wish you&#8217;d look upon me as your big brother.
Will you do that?&#8221; His voice entreated, and as she remained
silent, he continued: &#8220;Roaring Fork is one of the
worst towns in the State, and a girl like you needs some
one as a protector. I don&#8217;t know just how to put it so
that you will not misunderstand me, but, you see, I protect
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
the forest, the streams, and the game; I help the
settler in time of trouble; I am a kind of all-round big
brother to everybody who needs help in the forest. In
fact, I&#8217;m paid for protecting things that can&#8217;t protect
themselves, and so&#8221;&mdash;here he tried to lend his voice the
accent of humor&mdash;&#8220;why shouldn&#8217;t I be the protector of a
girl like you, alone&mdash;worse than alone&mdash;in this little cow-town?&#8221;</p>
<p>She remained dumb at one or two points where he
clearly hoped for a word, and she was unable to thank
him when he had finished. In this silence a curious
constriction came into his throat. It was almost as if
he had put his passion into definite words, and as the light
fell upon her he perceived that her bosom was heaving
with deep emotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>am</i> lonely,&#8221; she faltered out at last&mdash;&#8220;horribly
lonely; and I know now how people feel toward my
mother, and it hurts me&mdash;it all hurts me; but I&#8217;m
going to stay and help her&mdash;&#8221; She paused to recover
her voice. &#8220;And you <i>do</i> seem different! I&mdash;I&mdash;trust
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you understand me, and you <i>will</i> let me
know if I can help you, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, simply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; he said, extending his hand.</p>
<p>She placed her palm to his quite frankly, but the
touch of it made further speech at the moment impossible.</p>
<p>They went in with such tell-tale faces that even Redfield
wondered what had passed between them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>Excusing himself almost at once, Cavanagh left the
room, and when he looked in, a few moments later, he
was clothed in the ranger&#8217;s dusty green uniform, booted
and spurred for his long, hard ride. Mrs. Redfield
followed him into the hall and out on the door-stone to
say: &#8220;Ross, you must be careful. This girl is very alluring
in herself, but her mother, you know, is impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re needlessly alarmed, as usual,&#8221; he smilingly
replied. &#8220;She interests me&mdash;that&#8217;s patent; but beyond
that, why&mdash;nonsense! Good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite his protestations, he went away
up the trail with his mind so filled with Lee Virginia&#8217;s
appealing face and form that he would certainly have
ridden over a precipice had it not been for his experienced
pony, who had fortunately but one aim, and that was to
cross the range safely and to reach the home pasture at
the earliest moment.</p>
<p>Now that he was looking back upon three hours more
of Lee&#8217;s society, Cavanagh was ready to admit that he had
left his range and ridden hard and far with that one purpose
in mind. He had been hungry for the sight of her,
and now that he had touched her hand and looked upon
her again he was a little surprised and deeply disturbed
to find himself hungrier than before.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>
<h3>THE VOICE FROM THE HEIGHTS</h3>
</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Lee Virginia</span> was not entirely without experience as
regards respectful courtship. Her life in the East had
brought her to know a number of attractive lads and a
few men, but none of these had become more than good
companions, or friends; and though she wrote to one
or two of these youths letters of the utmost friendliness,
there was no passion in them, and she felt, as yet, the
sting of nothing more intense in her liking for Cavanagh;
but he meant more to her, now that she was lonely and
beleaguered of those whose eyes were cruel and hot.</p>
<p>Then, too, he had come to represent a new world to
her&mdash;this world of the forest, this region toward the sunset,
which was quite as mysterious to her thinking as it
was to the eyes of any plains-dweller. Her imagination
went with the ranger on his solitary march into those
vague, up-billowing masses of rocks and trees. To her
there were many dangers, and she wondered at his
courage, his hardihood.</p>
<p>That he had ridden all that long, rough way merely
to see her she was not vain enough to believe; but she
had, nevertheless, something of every woman&#8217;s secret
belief in her individual charm. Cavanagh had shown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
a flattering interest in her, and his wish to be her protector
filled her with joy and confidence.</p>
<p>She heard a good deal more about this particular
forest ranger next morning at breakfast. &#8220;He is throwing
himself away,&#8221; Mrs. Redfield passionately declared.
&#8220;Think of a man of Ross&#8217;s refinement living in a mountain
shack miles from anybody, watching poachers,
marking trees, and cooking his own food. It&#8217;s a shameful
waste of genius.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s as you look at it, my dear,&#8221; responded Redfield.
&#8220;Ross is the guardian of an immense treasure-chest
which belongs to the nation. Furthermore, he is
quite certain&mdash;as I am&mdash;that this Forest Service is the
policy of the future, and that it offers fine chances for
promotion&mdash;and then, finally, he likes it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is all well enough for a young man; but Ross is
at least thirty-five, and should be thinking of settling
down. I can&#8217;t understand his point of view.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear, you have never seen the procession of the
seasons from such a point of view as that which he enjoys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, and I do not care to. It is quite lonely enough
for me right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Redfield looked at Lee with comic blankness. &#8220;Mrs.
Redfield is hopelessly urban. As the wife of a forest
supervisor, she cares more for pavements and tram-cars
than for the most splendid mountain park.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I most certainly do,&#8221; his wife vigorously agreed.
&#8220;And if I had my way we should be living in London.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to that! She&#8217;s ten times more English than
Mrs. Enderby.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not; but I long for the civilized instead of the
wild. I like comfort and society.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; returned he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; the comfort of an easy-chair on the porch and
the society of your forest rangers. This ranch life
is all very well for a summer outing, but to be tied down
here all the year round is to be denied one&#8217;s birthright as
a modern.&#8221;</p>
<p>All this more or less cheerful complaint expressed the
minds of many others who live amid these superb scenes.
When autumn comes, when the sky is gray and the peaks
are hid in mist, they long for the music, the lights, the
comfort of the city; but when the April sun begins to go
down in a smother of crimson and flame, and the mountains
loom with epic dignity, or when at dawn the air is
like some divine flood descending from the unstained
mysterious heights, then the dweller in the foot-hills cries
out: &#8220;How fortunate we are! Here is health and happiness!
Here poverty is unknown!&#8221; One side of the
girl was of this strain, the other was of the character
described by her hostess. She began to see that Ross
Cavanagh was fitted for higher duties than those of
forest guard.</p>
<p>Mrs. Redfield was becoming more and more interested
in this child, who had not merely the malodorous reputation
of her mother to contend with, but the memory
of a traitorous sire to live down; and when Lee Virginia
went to her room to pack her bag, the wife turned to her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
husband and said: &#8220;What are we to think of heredity
when we see a thoroughly nice girl like that rise out of the
union of a desperado with a vixen?&#8221;</p>
<p>Redfield answered: &#8220;It is unaccountable. I knew
her father well; he was a reckless daredevil, with less
real courage in him than there is in old Lize; but I can&#8217;t
tell the girl that. She is sufficiently humiliated by her
mother; she takes comfort in the thought that her father
at least was brave and heroic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in heredity as I did once,&#8221; his wife
resumed. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t scientific men rather divided about
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there are those who deny that there is any inheritance
of the spirit, of character, insisting that the
laws of transmission affect the body only. Lee is certainly
like her father in looks. He was a handsome
rascal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ross is terribly smitten with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Redfield coughed, uneasily. &#8220;I hope not. Of course
he admires her, as any man must. She&#8217;s physically attractive,
very attractive, and, besides, Ross is as susceptible
as a cow-puncher. He was deeply impressed
the first time he saw her, I could see that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t like his going out on the veranda with her
last night,&#8221; continued Mrs. Redfield, &#8220;and when they
came in her eyes and color indicated that he&#8217;d been
saying something exciting to her. Hugh, Ross Cavanagh
must not get involved with that girl. It&#8217;s your duty as
his superior to warn him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s fully grown, my dear, and a bit dictatorial on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
his own part. I&#8217;m a trifle timid about cutting in on
his private affairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll do it. Marriage with a girl like that is
out of the question. Think what his sisters would say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Redfield smiled a bit satirically. &#8220;To the outsider
a forest ranger at $900 a year and find himself and horses
is not what you may call a brilliant catch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, the outsider is no judge. Ross Cavanagh
is a gentleman, and, besides, he&#8217;s sure to be promoted.
I acknowledge the girl&#8217;s charms, and I don&#8217;t understand
it. When I think of her objectively as Lize Wetherford&#8217;s
girl I wonder at her being in my house. When I
see her I want her to stay with me; I want to hug
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we&#8217;ve been unjust to Lize all along,&#8221; suggested
Redfield. &#8220;She has remained faithful to Ed
Wetherford&#8217;s memory all these years&mdash;that is conceded.
Doesn&#8217;t that argue some unusual quality? How many
women do we know who are capable of such loyalty?
Come, now! Lize is a rough piece of goods, I&#8217;ll admit,
and her fly-bit lunch-counter was a public nuisance;
but she had the courage to send her girl away to be
educated, denying herself the joy of seeing her develop
by her side. We mustn&#8217;t permit our prejudices to run
away with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s return put a stop to the discussion, which
could end in nothing but confusion anyway.</p>
<p>Lee Virginia said good-bye to Mrs. Redfield with
grateful appreciation of her kindness, and especially
of her invitation to come again, and the tears in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
eyes profoundly affected the older woman, who, with a
friendliness which was something more than politeness,
invited her to come again. &#8220;Whenever Roaring Fork
gets on your nerves we&#8217;ll be very glad to rescue you,&#8221; she
said in parting.</p>
<p>Hugh Redfield the girl thoroughly understood and
loved, he was so simple-hearted and so loyal. His
bitter criticisms of the West were not uttered in a destructive
mood&mdash;quite the contrary. His work was constructive
in the highest degree. He was profoundly impatient
of America&#8217;s shortcomings, for the reason that
he deeply felt her responsibility to the rest of the world.
His knowledge of other republics and &#8220;limited monarchies&#8221;
gave his suggestions power and penetration;
and even Bridges, besotted in his provincial selfishness,
had advised his selection as Supervisor. Of his own
fitness for the work, Redfield himself took a dispassionate
view. &#8220;I am only filling the place till the right man
comes along,&#8221; he said to his friends. &#8220;The man before
me was a half-hearted and shifty advocate. I am
an enthusiast without special training; by-and-by the
real forester will come to take my place.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the way to the office, he said to Lee: &#8220;I will talk
to the doctor if you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you would,&#8221; she responded, fervently.</p>
<p>She remained in the machine while he went in, and as
she sat there a train passed on its downward eastward
run, and a feeling of loneliness, of helplessness, filled her
heart. She had written many brave letters to her Eastern
friends, but the vital contests, the important factors of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
her life, she had not mentioned. She had given no hint
of her mother&#8217;s physical and moral degeneration, and
she had set down no word of her longing to return; but
now that she was within sight of the railway the call of
the East, the temptation to escape all her discomforts, was
almost great enough to carry her away; but into her mind
came the thought of the ranger riding his solitary way,
and she turned her face to her own duties once more,
comforted by the words of praise he had spoken and by
the blaze of admiration in his eyes.</p>
<p>Redfield came out, followed by a small man carrying
a neat bag. He was of surpassing ugliness, and yet she
liked him. His mouth had a curious twist. He had no
chin to speak of, and his bright eyes protruded like those
of a beetle. His voice, however, was surprisingly fine
and resonant.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better sit behind, Doctor,&#8221; said Redfield. &#8220;I
shall be very busy on this trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; replied the other, &#8220;if Miss Wetherford
remains beside me; otherwise I shall rebel.&#8221; He was
of those small, plain men whose absurd gallantry is never
taken seriously by women, and yet is something more
than pretence.</p>
<p>He began by asking a few questions about her mother&#8217;s
way of life, but as Lee was not very explicit, he became
impersonal, and talked of whatsoever came into his
mind&mdash;motor-cars, irrigation, hunting, flowers&mdash;anything
at all; and the girl had nothing to do but to utter an
occasional phrase to show that she was listening. It was
all rather depressing to her, for she could not understand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
how a man so garrulous could be a good physician. She
was quite sure her mother would not treat him with the
slightest respect.</p>
<p>After all, he talked well. His stream of conversation
shortened the way for her, and she was surprised when
they topped the last ridge and the Fork could be seen
lying before them in the valley. Soon they were rolling
quietly up the street to the door of the Wetherford House.</p>
<p>Springing out unaided, Lee hurried in, hoping to prepare
her mother for the shock of the little physician&#8217;s unimposing
appearance, while Redfield remained behind to
arm the physician for his encounter. &#8220;Now, Doctor,
Mrs. Wetherford is a very singular and plain-spoken
person. She&#8217;s quite likely to swear like a man, but she
will perform like a woman. Don&#8217;t mind what she says;
go ahead in your own way. Will you wait till after
dinner, or shall I&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I shall make the examination first&mdash;while I&#8217;m
hungry. My mind works quicker. I can&#8217;t diagnose
properly on a full stomach.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well; line up with me, and together we&#8217;ll beard
the old grizzly in her den.&#8221;</p>
<p>They found Lize on duty behind the counter as usual.
Her face was dejected, her eyes dull, but as she caught
sight of the strange little man, she cried out: &#8220;Lord God,
Reddy, why didn&#8217;t you bring me a <i>man</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, mother,&#8221; cautioned Lee, &#8220;this is the famous
Eastern physician.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t be famous for your beauty&mdash;you must be
brainy,&#8221; she remarked to herself in the stranger&#8217;s hearing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>Redfield presented &#8220;Doctor Fessenden, of Omaha.&#8221;</p>
<p>She started again on contemptuous ways, but was
stopped by the little man. &#8220;Get down out o&#8217; that
chair!&#8221; he commanded. &#8220;My time is money!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lize flushed with surprise and anger, but obeyed, and
Lee Virginia, secretly delighted with the physician&#8217;s imperative
manner, led the way into the lodging-house.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll look after the cash, mother,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
worry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not worryin&#8217;,&#8221; she replied; &#8220;but what does that
little whelp mean by talking to me like that? I&#8217;ll swat
him one if he isn&#8217;t careful!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s his way. Please don&#8217;t anger him. You need
his help.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor interfered. &#8220;Now, madam, strip, and let&#8217;s
see what&#8217;s the matter with you,&#8221; whereupon he laid off
his coat, and opened his box of instruments.</p>
<p>Lee fled, and Redfield, who had remained standing
beside the counter, could not repress a smile. &#8220;She&#8217;s
caught a tartar this time. He&#8217;s a little tiger, isn&#8217;t he?
I had prepared him for war, but I didn&#8217;t expect him to
fly at her that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor mother! how dreadfully ill she looks to-day.
I hope the doctor will order her to rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But will she obey? I&#8217;ve argued that with her. She
keeps saying she will, but she won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was nearly one, but the customers were coming in,
and the girl, laying aside her hat and veil, took her
seat at the cash-register, while Redfield went out to put
his machine in order for the return trip. She realized
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
that she was now at close-hand grapple with life. For
the most part she had been able, up to this time, to keep
in the background, and to avoid the eyes of the rough
men who came and went before her mother&#8217;s seat. But
now she was not merely exposed to their bold glances;
she was in a position where each man could make excuse
to stop and demand a word what time his change was
being counted.</p>
<p>Her glowing cheeks, her pretty dress, made her a shining
mark, and the men began at once to improve their
opportunity by asking, &#8220;Where&#8217;s Lize?&#8221; And this
embarrassed her, for the reason that she did not care
to go into the cause of her mother&#8217;s temporary absence,
and, perceiving her confusion, one of them passed to
coarse compliment. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing the matter with
you,&#8221; he said, with a leer. Others, though coarse, were
kindly in their familiarity, and Sifton, with gentle face,
remained to help her bear the jests of the more uncouth
and indelicate of her admirers.</p>
<p>Perceiving her nervousness, Neill Ballard raised loud
outcry over a mistake she made in returning change, and
this so confused and angered her that her eyes misted
with tears, and she blundered sadly with the next customer.
His delight in her discomfiture, his words, his
grin became unendurable, and in a flush of rage and
despair she sprang to her feet and left them to make
triumphant exit. &#8220;I got her rattled!&#8221; he roared, as he
went out. &#8220;She&#8217;ll remember me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The diners were all smiling, and Gregg took a malicious
satisfaction in her defeat. She had held herself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
haughtily apart from him, and he was glad to see her
humbled.</p>
<p>Leaving her place behind the counter, she walked
through the room with uplifted head and burning eyes,
her heart filled with bitterness and fire. She hated the
whole town, the whole State, at the moment. Were these
&#8220;the chivalrous short-grass knights&#8221; she had heard so
much about? These the large-souled &#8220;Western founders
of empire&#8221;? At the moment she was in the belief
that all the heroes of her childhood had been
of the stamp of Neill Ballard&mdash;selfish, lustful, and
cruel.</p>
<p>In the hall her pride, her sense of duty, came back to
her, and she halted her fleeing feet. &#8220;I will not be
beaten!&#8221; she declared, and her lips straightened. &#8220;I
will not let these dreadful creatures make a fool of me
in that way!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thereupon she turned and went back, pale now, but
resolved to prove herself the mistress of the situation.
Fortunately Redfield had returned, and his serene
presence helped her to recover complete control of herself.
She remained coldly blank to every compliment,
and by this means she subdued them. &#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t
the doctor return for his dinner?&#8221; she asked, after the
room had cleared. The desire to know her mother&#8217;s real
condition at last quite subordinated her own besetments.
To some of the older men whom she knew to be neighbors
and friends she gladly explained the situation, and
their sympathy did something to restore her faith in
humankind. Nevertheless, this hour of unprotected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
intercourse with the citizens of the town was disturbing,
humiliating, and embittering.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The doctor appearing suddenly in the door beckoned
to her, and, leaving her place, she crossed to where he
stood. &#8220;Your mother needs you,&#8221; he said, curtly. &#8220;Go
to her, and keep her quiet for an hour or two if you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter, doctor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you precisely, but you must get her on a
diet and keep her there. I will write out some lists for
you after my luncheon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee found her mother sitting in such dejection as she
had never known her to display, though she fired up
sufficiently to say: &#8220;That cussed little thimble-rigger has
been throwing a great big scare into me. He says I&#8217;ve
got to get out-doors, live on raw meat and weak tea, and
walk five miles a day. That&#8217;s what he says!&#8221; she added,
in renewed astonishment at the man&#8217;s audacity. &#8220;Who&#8217;s
at the cash?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Redfield,&#8221; replied Lee. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go right back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No you won&#8217;t, I&#8217;m no dead horse yet.&#8221; She struggled
to her feet and started for the cash-register. &#8220;I won&#8217;t
let no little Omaha doughgie like that put me out o&#8217;
business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite all warnings, she walked out into the dining-room
and took her accustomed seat with set and stern
face, while her daughter went to the table where the
doctor sat, and explained her inability to manage her
mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s <i>your</i> problem,&#8221; he replied, coolly. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
rapidly, succinctly, and clearly he went over the case,
and laid out a course of treatment. Out of it all Lee
deduced that her mother was very ill indeed, though not
in danger of sudden death.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s on the chute,&#8221; said Fessenden, &#8220;and everything
depends upon her own action whether she takes
the plunge this winter or twenty years from now. She&#8217;s
a strong woman&mdash;or has been&mdash;but she has presumed
upon her strength. She used to live out-of-doors, she
tells me, during all her early life, and now, shut in by
these walls, working sixteen hours a day, she is killing
herself. Get her out if you can, and cut out stimulants.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he rose and approached the counter, Lize shoved a
couple of gold pieces across the board. &#8220;That wipes
you off my map,&#8221; she grimly declared. &#8220;I hope you
enjoyed your ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s up to you, madam,&#8221; he replied, pocketing the
gold. &#8220;Good-day!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee followed him out to the car, eager to secure all she
could of his wisdom. He repeated his instructions.
&#8220;Medicine can&#8217;t help her much,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but diet can
do a great deal. Get her out of that rut she&#8217;s in. Good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be down again in a day or two!&#8221; called Redfield.</p>
<p>The machine began to purr and spit and the wheels
to spin, and Lee Virginia was left to face her mother&#8217;s
obstinate resistance alone. She felt suddenly very desolate,
very weak, and very poor. &#8220;What if mother should
die?&#8221; she asked herself.</p>
<p>Gregg was standing before the counter talking with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
Lize as Lee returned, and he said, with a broad smile:
&#8220;I&#8217;ve just been saying I&#8217;d take this hotel off your mother&#8217;s
hands provided you went with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the mouths of some men these words would have
been harmless enough, but coming from the tongue of
one whose life could only be obscurely hinted at the
jest was an insult. The girl shuddered with repulsion,
and Lize spoke out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Now see here, Bullfrog, I&#8217;m dead on the hoof and
all that, but neither you nor any other citizen like you can
be funny with my girl. She&#8217;s not for you. Now that&#8217;s
final! She ain&#8217;t your kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gregg&#8217;s smile died into a gray, set smirk, and his
eyes took on a steely glint. He knew when the naked,
unadorned truth was spoken to him. Words came slowly
to his lips, but he said: &#8220;You&#8217;ll be glad to come to me
for help some day&mdash;both of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, get along! You don&#8217;t hold no mortgage on
me,&#8221; retorted Lize, contemptuously, and turned to Lee.
&#8220;I&#8217;m hungry. Where&#8217;s that grub chart o&#8217; mine?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee brought the doctor&#8217;s page of notes and read it
through, while her mother snorted at intervals: &#8220;Hah!
dry toast, weak tea, no coffee, no alcohol. Huh! I
might as well starve! Eggs&mdash;fish&mdash;milk! Why didn&#8217;t he
say boiled live lobsters and champagne? I tell you right
now, I&#8217;m not going to go into that kind of a game. If
I die I&#8217;m going to die eating what I blame please.&#8221;</p>
<p>The struggle had begun. With desperate courage
Lee fought, standing squarely in the rut of her mother&#8217;s
daily habit. &#8220;You must not hive up here any longer,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
she insisted; &#8220;you must get out and walk and ride. I
can take care of the house&mdash;at least, till we can sell it.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was like breaking the pride of an athlete, but little
by little she forced upon her mother a realization of her
true condition, and at last Lize consented to offer the
business for sale. Then she wept (for the first time in
years), and the sight moved her daughter much as the
sobs of a strong man would have done.</p>
<p>She longed for the presence of Ross Cavanagh at this
moment, when all her little world seemed tumbling into
ruin; and almost in answer to her wordless prayer came
a messenger from the little telephone office: &#8220;Some one
wants to talk to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She answered this call hurriedly, thinking at first that
it must be Mrs. Redfield. The booth was in the little
sitting-room of a private cottage, and the mistress of the
place, a shrewd little woman with inquisitive eyes, said:
&#8220;Sounds to me like Ross Cavanagh&#8217;s voice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee was thankful for the booth&#8217;s privacy, for her
cheeks flamed up at this remark; and when she took up
the receiver her heart was beating so loud it seemed as
if the person at the other end of the wire must hear it.
&#8220;Who is it, please?&#8221; she asked, with breathless intensity.</p>
<p>A man&#8217;s voice came back over the wire so clear, so
distinct, so intimate, it seemed as if he were speaking into
her ear. &#8220;It is I, Ross Cavanagh. I want to ask how
your mother is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is terribly disheartened by what the doctor has
said, but she is in no immediate danger.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>He perceived her agitation, and was instantly sympathetic.
&#8220;Can I be of use&mdash;do you need me? If you
do, I&#8217;ll come down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am at the sawmill&mdash;the nearest telephone station.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How far away are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About thirty miles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; She expressed in this little sound her disappointment,
and as it trembled over the wire he spoke
quickly: &#8220;Please tell me! Do you want me to come
down? Never mind the distance&mdash;I can ride it in a
few hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was tempted, but bravely said: &#8220;No; I&#8217;d like to
see you, of course, but the doctor said mother was in no
danger. You must not come on our account.&#8221;</p>
<p>He felt the wonder of the moment&#8217;s intercourse over
the wilderness steeps, and said so. &#8220;You can&#8217;t imagine
how strangely sweet and civilized your voice sounds to
me here in this savage place. It makes me hope that
some day you and Mrs. Redfield will come up and visit
me in person.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it would do your mother good to camp for
a while. Can&#8217;t you persuade her to do so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to do that&mdash;I mean, to stop work; but
she says, &#8216;What can we do to earn a living?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If nothing happens I hope to spend an hour or two
at the Forks next Sunday. I hope to find your mother
better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their words were of this unemotional sort, but in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
their voices something subtler than the electrical current
vibrated. He called to her in wordless fashion and
she answered in the same mysterious code, and when
she said &#8220;Good-bye&#8221; and hung up the receiver her world
went suddenly gray and commonplace, as if a ray of
special sunlight had been withdrawn.</p>
<p>The attendant asked, with village bluntness: &#8220;It <i>was</i>
Ross, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee Virginia resented this almost as much as if it
were the question of an eavesdropper; but she answered:
&#8220;Yes; he wanted to know how my mother was.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned as she reached the street and looked up
toward the glorious purpling deeps from which the
ranger&#8217;s voice had come, and the thought that he was
the sole guardian of those dark forests and shining
streams&mdash;that his way led among those towering peaks
and lone canons&mdash;made of him something altogether
admirable.</p>
<p>That night her loneliness, her sense of weakness, carried
her to bed with tears of despair in her eyes. Lize
had insisted on going back to her work looking like one
stricken with death, yet so rebellious that her daughter
could do nothing with her; and in the nature of fate the
day&#8217;s business had been greater than ever, so that they
had all been forced to work like slaves to feed the flood
of custom. And Lize herself still kept her vigil in her
chair above her gold.</p>
<p>Closing her mind to the town and all it meant to her,
the girl tried to follow, in imagination, the ranger treading
his far, high trails. She recalled his voice, so cultivated,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
so rich of inflection, with dangerous tenderness.
It had come down to her from those lofty parapets like
that of a friend, laden with something sweeter than
sympathy, more alluring than song.</p>
<p>The thought of some time going up to the high country
where he dwelt came to her most insistently, and she
permitted herself to dream of long days of companionship
with him, of riding through sunlit aisles of forest
with him, of cooking for him at the cabin&mdash;what time
her mother grew strong once more&mdash;and these dreams
bred in her heart a wistful ache, a hungry need which
made her pillow a place of mingled ecstasy and pain.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>
<h3>THE POACHERS</h3>
</div>

<p>One morning, as he topped the rise between the sawmill
and his own station, Cavanagh heard two rifle-shots
in quick succession snapping across the high peak on
his left. Bringing his horse to a stand, he unslung his
field-glasses, and slowly and minutely swept the tawny
slopes of Sheep Mountain from which the forbidden
sounds seemed to come.</p>
<p>&#8220;A herder shooting coyotes,&#8221; was his first thought;
then remembering that there were no camps in that
direction, and that a flock of mountain-sheep (which he
had been guarding carefully) habitually fed round that
grassy peak, his mind changed. &#8220;I wonder if those
fellows are after those sheep?&#8221; he mused, as he angled
down the slope. &#8220;I reckon it&#8217;s up to me to see.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was tired and hungry, a huge moraine lay between,
and the trail was long and rough. &#8220;To catch them in the
act is impossible. However,&#8221; he reflected, &#8220;they have but
two trails along which to descend. One of these passes
my door, and the other, a very difficult trail, leads down the
South Fork. I&#8217;ll have time to get breakfast and change
horses. They&#8217;ll probably wait till night before attempting
to go out, anyway.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>In less than three hours he was over on the trail in the
canon, quite certain that the hunters were still above him.
He rode quietly up the valley, pausing often to listen
and to scrutinize the landscape; but no sign of camp-fire
and no further rifle-shots came, and at last he went
into camp upon the trail, resolved to wait till the poachers
appeared, a ward which his experience as a soldier
helped him to maintain without nodding.</p>
<p>In these long hours his thought played about the remembrance
of his last visit to the Fork and his hour with
Lee. He wondered what she was doing at the moment.
How charming she had looked there at Redfields&#8217;&mdash;so
girlish in form, so serious and womanly of face!</p>
<p>He felt as never before the ineludible loneliness of the
ranger&#8217;s life. Here he sat in the midst of a mighty forest
with many hostile minds all about him, and it must be
confessed he began to wonder whether his services to the
nation were worth so much hardship, such complete
isolation. The stream sang of the eternities, and his
own short span of life (half gone already without any
permanent accomplishment) seemed pitifully ephemeral.
The guardians of these high places must forever be
solitary. No ranger could rightfully be husband and
father, for to bring women and children into these
solitudes would be cruel.</p>
<p>He put all this aside&mdash;for the time&mdash;by remembering
that he was a soldier under orders, and that marriage
was a long way off, and so smoked his pipe and waited
for the dawn, persistent as a Sioux, and as silent as a fox.</p>
<p>At daylight, there being still no sign of his quarry, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
saddled his horse, and was about to ride up the trail
when he caught the sound of voices and the sharp click
of iron hoofs on the rocks above him. With his horse&#8217;s
bridle on his arm he awaited the approaching horseman,
resolute and ready to act.</p>
<p>As the marauders rounded the elbow in the trail, he
was surprised to recognize in the leader young Gregg.
The other man was a stranger, an older man, with a
grizzled beard, and tall and stooping figure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello Joe,&#8221; called the ranger, &#8220;you&#8217;re astir early!&#8221;</p>
<p>The youth&#8217;s fat face remained imperturbable, but his
eyes betrayed uneasiness. &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s a long pull into
town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Been hunting?&#8221; queried the ranger, still with cheery,
polite interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no; just visiting one of my sheep-camps.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh&#8217;s voice was a little less suave. &#8220;Not on
this creek,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;I moved your herder last
week.&#8221; He walked forward. &#8220;That&#8217;s a heavy load for
a short trip to a sheep-camp.&#8221; He put his hand on the
pack. &#8220;I guess you&#8217;ll have to open this, for I heard
two shots yesterday morning up where that flock of
mountain-sheep is running, and, furthermore, I can see
blood-stains on this saddle-blanket.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither of the men made answer, but the old man
turned an inquiring look at his young leader.</p>
<p>The ranger flung his next sentence out like the lash
of a whip. &#8220;Open this sack or I cut the ropes!&#8221;</p>
<p>Gregg threw out a hand in command. &#8220;<i>Open it up,
Edwards!</i>&#8221; he said, sullenly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>With mechanical readiness the guide alighted from
his horse, loosened the cinch on the pack-horse, and disclosed
the usual camp-bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put off that bedding!&#8221; insisted the ranger.</p>
<p>Off came the outfit, and under the tent lay the noble
head of a wild ram&mdash;a look of reproach still in his splendid
yellow eyes.</p>
<p>Cavanagh&#8217;s face hardened. &#8220;I thought so. Now
heave it back and cinch up. It&#8217;s you to the nearest
magistrate, which happens to be Higley, of Roaring
Fork. I&#8217;ll make an example of you fellows.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was nothing for Gregg to say and nothing for
Edwards to do but obey, for a resolute ranger with
an excellent weapon of the latest and most approved
angular pattern stood ready to enforce his command;
and when the pack was recinched, Cavanagh waved an
imperative hand. &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll have to take charge of
your guns,&#8221; he said, and they yielded without a word
of protest. &#8220;Now march! Take the left-hand trail.
I&#8217;ll be close behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>A couple of hours of silent travel brought them to the
ranger&#8217;s cabin, and there he ordered a dismount.</p>
<p>As the coffee was boiling he lectured them briefly.
&#8220;You fellows are not entirely to blame,&#8221; he remarked,
philosophically. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been educated to think a
game warden a joke and Uncle Sam a long way off.
But things have changed a bit. The law of the State
has made me game warden, and I&#8217;m going to show you
how it works. It&#8217;s my duty to see that you go down the
road&mdash;and down you go!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>Edwards, the guide, was plainly very uneasy, and
made several attempts to reach Cavanagh&#8217;s private ear,
and at last succeeded. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been fooled into this,&#8221; he
urged. &#8220;I was hard up and a stranger in the country,
and this young fellow hired me to guide him across the
range. I didn&#8217;t shoot a thing. I swear I didn&#8217;t. If
you&#8217;ll let me off, I&#8217;ll hit the trail to the West and never
look back. For God&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t take me down the
road! Let me off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; replied Cavanagh; but his tone was
kindlier, for he perceived that the old fellow was thin,
hollow-chested, and poorly clad. &#8220;You knew you were
breaking the laws, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>This the culprit admitted. &#8220;But I was working for
Sam Gregg, and when Joe asked me to go show him
the trail, I didn&#8217;t expect to get cinched for killing
game. I didn&#8217;t fire a shot&mdash;now that&#8217;s the God&#8217;s
truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevertheless,&#8221; retorted Ross, &#8220;you were packing
the head, and I must count you in the game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edwards fell silent then, but something in his look
deepened the ranger&#8217;s pity. His eyes were large and
dark, and his face so emaciated that he seemed fit only
for a sanitarium.</p>
<p>The trip to the Fork (timed to the gait of a lazy pack-horse)
was a tedious eight hours&#8217; march, and it was
nearly seven o&#8217;clock when they arrived at the outskirts
of the village. There had been very few words spoken
by Cavanagh, and those which the prisoners uttered
were not calculated to cheer the way. Joe blamed his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
guide for their mishap. &#8220;You should have known how
far the sound of our guns would carry,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As they were nearing the village he called out: &#8220;See
here, Cavanagh, there&#8217;s no use taking me through town
under arrest. I&#8217;ll cough up all we got right now. How
much is the damage?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t receive your fine,&#8221; replied Ross, &#8220;and, besides,
you took your chances when you shot that sheep. You
lost out, and I&#8217;m not going to let you off. This poaching
must stop. You go right along with your guide.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Edwards drew near, and pled in a low voice:
&#8220;See here, Mr. Ranger, I have special reasons why I
don&#8217;t want to go into this town under arrest. I wish
you&#8217;d let me explain.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was deep emotion in his voice, but Ross was
firm. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but my duty requires
me to take you before a magistrate&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t know my case,&#8221; he replied, with bitter
intensity. &#8220;I&#8217;m out &#8216;on parole.&#8217; I can&#8217;t afford to be
arrested in this way. Don&#8217;t you see?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross looked at him closely. &#8220;<i>Are</i> you telling me the
truth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you have mercy on me if I were?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be sorry for you, but I couldn&#8217;t let you
go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t believe me, but it&#8217;s the God Almighty&#8217;s
truth: I didn&#8217;t know Joe intended to kill that sheep.
He asked me to show him over the pass. I had no intention
of killing anything. I wish to God you would
let me go!&#8221; His voice was tense with pleading.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How about this, Gregg?&#8221; called Ross. &#8220;Your guide
insists he had no hand in killing the ram?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He fired first, and I fired and finished him,&#8221; retorted
Gregg.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas the other way,&#8221; declared Edwards. &#8220;The
beast was crippled and escaping&mdash;I killed him with my
revolver. I didn&#8217;t want to see him go off and die&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess that settles it,&#8221; said Cavanagh, decisively.
&#8220;You take your medicine with Joe. If the justice wants
to let you off easy, I can&#8217;t help it, but to turn you loose
now would mean disloyalty to the service. Climb back
into your saddle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edwards turned away with shaking hands and unsteady
step. &#8220;All right,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll meet it.&#8221; He
came back to say: &#8220;There&#8217;s no need of your saying anything
about what I&#8217;ve told you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you are a stranger to me. I know nothing of
your life except that I found you with Joe, with this pack
on your horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Much obliged,&#8221; said he, with a touch of bitter humor.</p>
<p>To the casual observer in a town of this character there
was nothing specially noticeable in three horsemen
driving a pack-horse, but to those whose eyes were keen
the true relationship of the ranger to his captives was
instantly apparent, and when they alighted at Judge
Higley&#8217;s office a bunch of eager observers quickly
collected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello Joe, what luck?&#8221; called Ballard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our luck was a little too good&mdash;we caught a game
warden,&#8221; replied the young scapegrace.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>The ranger was chagrined to find the office of the
justice closed for the day, and, turning to his captives,
said: &#8220;I&#8217;m hungry, and I&#8217;ve no doubt you are. I&#8217;m going
to take you into Mike Halsey&#8217;s saloon for supper, but
remember you are my prisoners.&#8221; And to the little
old remittance man, Sifton, who caught his eye, he explained
his need of a justice and the town marshal.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to find the judge,&#8221; replied Sifton, with ready
good-will, and at a sign from the ranger, Gregg and his
herder entered the saloon.</p>
<p>In fifteen minutes the town was rumbling with the
news. Under Ballard&#8217;s devilry, all the latent hatred of
the ranger and all the concealed opposition to the
Forest Service came to the surface like the scum on a pot
of broth. The saloons and eating-houses boiled with
indignant protest. &#8220;What business is it of Ross Cavanagh&#8217;s?&#8221;
they demanded. &#8220;What call has he to interfere?
He&#8217;s not a game warden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes he is. All these rangers are game wardens,&#8221;
corrected another.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they&#8217;re not. They have to be commissioned by
the Governor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s been commissioned; he&#8217;s warden all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it. Anyhow, he&#8217;s too fresh. He
needs to have a halt. Let&#8217;s do him. Let&#8217;s bluff him
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee Virginia was in the kitchen superintending the
service when one of the waiters came in, breathless with
excitement. &#8220;Ross Cavanagh has shot Joe Gregg for
killing sheep!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>Lee faced her with blanched face. &#8220;Who told you
so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re all talking about it out there. Gee! but
they&#8217;re hot. Some of &#8217;em want to lynch him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee hurried out into the dining-room, which was
crowded with men and voicing deep excitement. Anger
was in the air&mdash;a stormy rage, perceptible as a hot blast;
and as she passed one table after another she heard ugly
phrases applied to Cavanagh.</p>
<p>A half-dozen men were standing before the counter
talking with Lize, but Lee pushed in to inquire with
white, inquiring face: &#8220;What is it all about? What
has happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing much,&#8221; Lize replied, contemptuously, &#8220;but
you&#8217;d think a horse had been stole. Ross has nipped
Joe Gregg and one of his herders for killing mountain-sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean he shot them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; he took their heads.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee stood aghast. &#8220;What do you mean? Whose
heads?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lize laughed. &#8220;The sheeps&#8217; heads. Oh, don&#8217;t be
scared, no one is hurt yet!&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl flushed with confusion as the men roared
over her blunder. &#8220;One of the girls told me Mr. Cavanagh
had killed a man,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;Where is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lize betrayed annoyance. &#8220;They say he&#8217;s taking
supper at Mike Halsey&#8217;s, though why he didn&#8217;t come
here I don&#8217;t see. What&#8217;s he going to do?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;Won&#8217;t the marshal take the men off his hands?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not without warrant from Higley, and Higley is
out of town. Ross&#8217;ll have to hold &#8217;em till Higley gets
back, or else take &#8217;em over to Chauvenet,&#8221; Lize snorted.
&#8220;Old Higley! Yes, he&#8217;s been known to disappear before
when there was some real work to be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl looked about her with a sharpening realization
of the fact that all these men were squarely opposed
to the ranger, and rather glad to know that his guardianship
of the poachers was to be rendered troublesome.
She could hear on all sides bitter curses openly directed
against him. How little of real manliness could be detected
in these grinning or malignant faces! Ill-formed,
half-developed, bestial most of them, while others, though
weakly good-humored, were ready to go with whatever
current of strong passion blew upon them. Over against
such creatures Ross Cavanagh stood off in heroic contrast&mdash;a
man with work to do, and doing it like a patriot.</p>
<p>She went back to her own task with a vague sense of
alarm. &#8220;Certainly they will not dare to interfere with
an officer in the discharge of his duties,&#8221; she thought.
She was eager to see him, and the thought that he might
be obliged to ride away to Chauvenet without a word to
her gave her a deeper feeling of annoyance and unrest.
That he was in any real danger she could not believe.</p>
<p>It was disheartening to Cavanagh to see how some of
the most influential citizens contrived to give encouragement
to the riotous element of the town. A wink, a
gesture, a careless word to the proper messenger, conveyed
to the saloon rounders an assurance of sympathy
which inflamed their resentment to the murderous point.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>The truth is, this little village, sixty miles from the
railway, still retained in its dives and shanties the
lingering miasma of the old-time free-range barbarism.
It trailed a dark history on its legal side as well as on its
openly violent side, for it had been one of the centres of
the Rustler&#8217;s War, and one of the chief points of attack
on the part of the cattle-barons. It was still a rendezvous
for desperate and shameless characters&mdash;a place
of derelicts, survivals of the days of deep drinking, furious
riding, and ready gun-play.</p>
<p>True, its famous desperadoes were now either dead or
distantly occupied; but the mantle of violence, the tradition
of lawlessness, had fallen to the seedy old cow-punchers
and to the raw and vulgar youths from the ill-conditioned
homes of the middle West. The air of the
reckless old-time range still clung rancidly in the low
groggeries, as a deadly gas hangs about the lower levels
of a mine. It was confessedly one of the worst communities
in the State.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s run the sonovagun!&#8221; was the suggestion of
several of Gregg&#8217;s friends.</p>
<p>The fact that the ranger was a commissioned officer of
the law, and that the ram&#8217;s head had been found on the
poacher&#8217;s pack, made very little difference to these irresponsible
instigators to assault. It was wonderful
how highly that loafing young rascal, Joe Gregg, was
prized at the moment. &#8220;It&#8217;s an outrage that the son of
a leading citizen should be held up in this way by one of
the forestry Cossacks,&#8221; declared one of the merchants.</p>
<p>The discussion which took place over the bars of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
town was at the riot-heat by nine o&#8217;clock, and soon after
ten a crowd of howling, whooping bad boys, and disreputable
ranch-hands was parading the walks, breathing
out vile threats against the ranger.</p>
<p>Accustomed to men of this type, Cavanagh watched
them come and go at Halsey&#8217;s bar with calculating eyes.
&#8220;There will be no trouble for an hour or two, but meanwhile
what is to be done? Higley is not to be found,
and the town marshal is also &#8216;out of town.&#8217;&#8221; To
Halsey he said: &#8220;I am acting, as you know, under both
Federal and State authority, and I call upon you as a
law-abiding citizen to aid me in holding these men prisoners.
I shall camp right here till morning, or until the
magistrate or the marshal relieves me of my culprits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Halsey was himself a sportsman&mdash;a genuine lover of
hunting and a fairly consistent upholder of the game
laws; but perceiving that the whole town had apparently
lined up in opposition to the ranger, he lost courage.
His consent was half-hearted, and he edged away toward
the front window of his bar-room, nervously seeking to
be neutral&mdash;&#8220;to carry water on both shoulders,&#8221; as the
phrase goes.</p>
<p>The talk grew less jocular as the drinks took effect,
and Neill Ballard, separating himself from the crowd,
came forward, calling loudly: &#8220;Come out o&#8217; there, Joe!
Youse a hell of a sport! Come out and have a drink!&#8221;</p>
<p>His words conveyed less of battle than his tone. He
was, in fact, urging a revolt, and Cavanagh knew it.</p>
<p>Gregg rose as if to comply. The ranger stopped him.
&#8220;Keep your seat,&#8221; said he. And to Ballard he warningly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
remarked: &#8220;And you keep away from my prisoners.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you own this saloon?&#8221; retorted the fellow, truculently.
&#8220;I reckon Halsey&#8217;s customers have some rights.
What are you doing here, anyway? This is no jail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Halsey has given me the privilege of holding my
prisoners here till the justice is found. It isn&#8217;t my fault
that the town is without judge or jail.&#8221; He was weakened
by the knowledge that Halsey had only half-consented
to aid justice; but his pride was roused, and he
was determined upon carrying his arrest to its legitimate
end. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to see that these men are punished if
I have to carry them to Sulphur City,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Smash the lights!&#8221; shouted some one at the back.</p>
<p>Here was the first real note of war, and Ross cried
out sharply: &#8220;If a man lifts a hand toward the light I&#8217;ll
cut it off!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a stealthy movement in the crowd, and
leaping upon the counter a reckless cub reached for the
lamp.</p>
<p>Cavanagh&#8217;s revolver shattered the globe in the fellow&#8217;s
very palm. &#8220;Get down from there!&#8221; he commanded.</p>
<p>The crowd surged back against the front door, several
drawn weapons shining in their hands. Some of the
faces were a-grin, others were thrust forward like the
heads of snakes, their eyes glittering with hate.</p>
<p>It is an appalling moment to a man of discernment
when he looks into the faces of his fellows and hears
only the laugh of the wolf, the hiss of the snake, the snarl
of the tiger. At the moment Cavanagh despised with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
measureless contempt the entire commonwealth and its
long-established school of violence; but fixing his thought
on his far-away chief, he lost all fear. His voice was
perfectly calm as he said: &#8220;I am wearing the uniform
of the Federal service, and the man that interferes with
me will feel the vengeance of the Federal arm. You
can get me, but I&#8217;ll get some of you at the same time,
and the department will get the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mob had not found its leader. It hesitated and
blustered but did not strike, and eventually edged out
of the door and disappeared; but the silence which followed
its retreat was more alarming to the ranger than
its presence. Some slyer mischief was in these minds.
He feared that they were about to cut the electric-light
wires, and so plunge him into darkness, and to prepare
for that emergency he called upon the bartender (Halsey
having vanished) for a lamp or a lantern.</p>
<p>The fellow sullenly set about this task, and Ross, turning
to Gregg, said: &#8220;If you&#8217;ve any influence with this
mob, you&#8217;d better use it to keep them out of mischief,
for I&#8217;m on this job to the bitter end, and somebody&#8217;s
going to be hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gregg, who seemed quite detached from the action
and rather delighted with it, replied: &#8220;I have no influence.
They don&#8217;t care a hang about me; they have
it in for you, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edwards remained silent, with his hat drawn low over
his eyes. It was evident that he was anxious to avoid
being seen and quite willing to keep out of the conflict;
but with no handcuffs and the back door of the saloon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
unguarded, Ross was aware that his guard must be incessant
and alertly vigilant. &#8220;Where are the law-abiding
citizens of the town?&#8221; he asked of Sifton, who
remained in the saloon.</p>
<p>The dry little whisp of manhood had some spark of
life in him, for he said: &#8220;In their beds, the cowardly
hounds!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They must know that this gang of hobos is threatening
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly they do; but they don&#8217;t intend to endanger
their precious hides. They would be well
pleased to have you disabled.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was incredible! Low as his estimate of the Fork
had been, Cavanagh could not believe that it would sit
quietly by and see an officer of the State defeated in his
duty. &#8220;Such a thing could not happen under the English
flag,&#8221; he said, and at the moment his adopted country
seemed a miserable makeshift. Only the thought of
Redfield and the chief nerved him for the long vigil.
&#8220;The chief will understand if it comes up to him,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>Lize Wetherford came hurrying in, looking as though
she had just risen from her bed. She was clothed in a
long red robe, her grizzled hair was loose, her feet were
bare, and she carried a huge old-fashioned revolver in
her hand. Her mouth was stern.</p>
<p>Stopping abruptly as she caught sight of Ross standing
in the middle of the floor unhurt, she exclaimed:
&#8220;There you are! Are you all right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As a trivet,&#8221; he replied.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>She let her gun-hand relax. &#8220;What was the shooting?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A little bluff on my part.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was much relieved. &#8220;I was afraid they&#8217;d got
you. I came as quick as I could. I was abed. That
fool doctor threw a chill into me, and I&#8217;ve been going to
roost early according to orders. I didn&#8217;t hear your gun,
but Lee did, and she came to tell me. They&#8217;re hell-roaring
down the street yet. Don&#8217;t let &#8217;em get behind you.
If I was any good I&#8217;d stay and help. Where&#8217;s Mike?&#8221;
She addressed the tender at the bar.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Gone home, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sneaked, has he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So far as I know the only law-upholding citizen in
the place, barring yourself, is Sifton,&#8221; said Ross, indicating
the Englishman, who stood as if cold, pressing
his hands together to hide their trembling.</p>
<p>Lize perceived the irony of this. &#8220;Two Britishers
and two women! Well, by God, this is a fine old town!
What you going to do&mdash;hold your men here all
night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any other way. Halsey turned the place
over to me&mdash;but&mdash;&#8221; He looked about him suspiciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring &#8217;em into my place. Lee has had new locks
put on our doors; they&#8217;ll help some.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to do that, Mrs. Wetherford,&#8221; he replied,
with greater respect than he had ever shown her
before. &#8220;They may attack me there.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All the better; I&#8217;ll be on hand to help&mdash;but they&#8217;re
less likely to boil in on you through a locked door.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But your daughter? It will alarm her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll be in the other house, and, besides, she&#8217;d feel
easier if you are in my place. She&#8217;s all wrought up by
the attack on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross turned to his prisoners. &#8220;Follow Mrs. Wetherford
and&mdash;eyes front!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t worry about me,&#8221; said Joe, &#8220;I won&#8217;t
run.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t intend to give you a chance,&#8221; replied Ross.</p>
<p>Edwards seemed to have lost in both courage and
physical stature; he slouched along with shuffling step,
his head bent and his face pale. Ross was now profoundly
sorry for him, so utterly craven and broken was
his look.</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>
<h3>THE SECOND ATTACK</h3>
</div>

<p>Lee was waiting on the porch of the hotel, tense with
excitement, straining her ears and eyes to see what was
taking place.</p>
<p>The night had started with a small sickle of moon, but
this had dropped below the range, leaving the street
dark, save where the lights from the windows of the
all-night eating-houses and saloons lay out upon the
walk, and, while she stood peering out, the sound of
rancorous howling and shrill whooping came to her ears
with such suggestion of ferocity that she shivered.</p>
<p>Every good and honorable trait seemed lost out of her
neighbors. She saw the whole country but as a refuge
for criminals, ungovernable youths, and unsexed women&mdash;a
wilderness of those who had no regard for any code
of morals which interfered with their own desires. Her
memories of the past freshened as she listened. In
such wise she had shuddered, as a child, while troops
of celebrating cowboys rode up and down the streets.
In such wise, too, the better (and more timid) element of
the town had put out their lights and retired, leaving
their drunken helots and the marshal to fight it out in
vague tumult.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>A few of the hotel guests had gone to bed, but the
women were up, excited and nervous, starting at every
fresh outburst of whooping, knowing that their sons or
husbands were out in the street &#8220;to see the fun,&#8221; and
that they might meet trouble.</p>
<p>At last Lee discerned her mother returning from Halsey&#8217;s,
followed by three men. Withdrawing from the little
porch whereon she had been standing, she reentered
the house to meet her mother in the hall. &#8220;Where is
Mr. Cavanagh?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out in the dining-room. You see, Mike Halsey is
no kind o&#8217; use. He vamoosed and left Ross down there
alone, with his two prisoners and the lights likely to
be turned out on him. So I offered the caffy as a calaboose.
They are sure in for a long and tedious night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee was alarmed at her mother&#8217;s appearance. &#8220;You
must go to bed. You look ghastly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;d better lie down for a little while, but I
can&#8217;t sleep. Ross may need me. There isn&#8217;t a man to
help him but me, and that loafer Ballard is full of gall.
He&#8217;s got it in for Ross, and will make trouble if he
can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What can we do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shoot!&#8221; replied Lize, with dry brevity. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t
mind a chance to plug some of the sweet citizens of this
town. I owe them one or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this sentence in her ears, Lee Virginia went
to her bed, but not to slumber. Her utter inability
either to control her mother&#8217;s action or to influence that
of the mob added to her uneasiness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>The singing, shouting, trampling of the crowd went
on, and once a group of men halted just outside her
window, and she heard Neill Ballard noisily, drunkenly
arguing as to the most effective method of taking the
prisoners. His utterances, so profane and foul, came to
her like echoes from out an inferno. The voices were
all at the moment like the hissing of serpents, the snarling
of tigers. How dared creatures of this vile type use
words of contempt against Ross Cavanagh?</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, boys!&#8221; urged Ballard, his voice filled with
reckless determination. &#8220;Let&#8217;s run him.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they passed, the girl sprang up and went to her
mother&#8217;s room to warn her of the threatened attack.</p>
<p>Lize was already awake and calmly loading a second
revolver by the light of the electric bulb.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; the girl asked, her blood chilling
at sight of the weapon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell&#8217;s to pay out there, and I&#8217;m going to help pay
it.&#8221; A jarring blow was heard. &#8220;Hear that! They&#8217;re
breaking in&mdash;&#8221; She started to leave the room.</p>
<p>Lee stopped her. &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To help Ross. Here!&#8221; She thrust the handle of
a smaller weapon into Lee&#8217;s hand. &#8220;Ed Wetherford&#8217;s
girl ought to be able to take care of herself. Come on!&#8221;</p>
<p>With a most unheroic horror benumbing her limbs,
Lee followed her mother through the hall. The sound
of shouts and the trampling of feet could be heard, and
she came out into the restaurant just in time to photograph
upon her brain a scene whose significance was at
once apparent. On a chair between his two prisoners,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
and confronting Ballard at the head of a crowd of frenzied
villains, stood the ranger, a gleaming weapon in his
hand, a look of resolution on his face.</p>
<p>What he had said, or what he intended to do, she did
not learn, for her mother rushed at the invaders with the
mad bravery of a she-bear. &#8220;Get out of here!&#8221; she
snarled, thrusting her revolver into the very mouth of
the leader.</p>
<p>They all fell back in astonishment and fear.</p>
<p>Ross leaped to her side. &#8220;Leave them to me!&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll clear the room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not on your life! This is my house. I have the
right to smash the fools.&#8221; And she beat them over the
heads with her pistol-barrel.</p>
<p>Recognizing that she was minded to kill, they retreated
over the threshold, and Ross, drawing the door close
behind them, turned to find Lee Virginia confronting
Edwards, who had attempted to escape into the kitchen.
The girl&#8217;s face was white, but the eye of her revolver
stared straight and true into her prisoner&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>With a bound Ross seized him and flung him against
the wall. &#8220;Get back there!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;You must
take your medicine with your boss.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old fellow hurriedly replaced his ragged hat, and,
folding his arms, sank back into his chair with bowed
head, while Lize turned upon Joe Gregg. &#8220;What the
devil did you go into this kind of deal for? You knew
what the game laws was, didn&#8217;t you? Your old dad is
all for State regulation, and here you are breaking a State
law. Why don&#8217;t you stand up for the code like a sport?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>Joe, who had been boasting of the smiles he had drawn
from Lee, did not relish this tongue-lashing from her
mother, but, assuming a careless air, he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m all
out of smokes; get me a box, that&#8217;s a good old soul.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lize regarded him with the expression of one nonplussed.
&#8220;You impudent little cub!&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;What you need is a booting!&#8221;</p>
<p>The ranger addressed himself to Lee. &#8220;I want to
thank you for a very opportune intervention. I didn&#8217;t
know you could handle a gun so neatly.&#8221;</p>
<p>She flushed with pleasure. &#8220;Oh yes, I can shoot.
My father taught me when I was only six years old.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she spoke, Ross caught the man Edwards studying
them with furtive glance, but, upon being observed, he
resumed his crouching attitude, which concealed his face
beneath the rim of his weather-worn hat. It was evident
that he was afraid of being recognized. He had the slinking
air of the convict, and his form, so despairing in its
lax lines, appealed to Lee with even greater poignancy
than his face. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; she said to him, &#8220;but it was
my duty to help Mr. Cavanagh.&#8221;</p>
<p>He glanced up with a quick sidewise slant. &#8220;That&#8217;s
all right, miss; I should have had sense enough to keep
out of this business.&#8221; He spoke with difficulty, and his
voice was hoarse with emotion.</p>
<p>Lize turned to Lee. &#8220;The Doc said &#8216;no liquor,&#8217; but I
guess here&#8217;s where I draw one&mdash;I feel faint.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross hurried to her side, while young Gregg tendered
a handsome flask. &#8220;Here&#8217;s something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lize put it away. &#8220;Not from you. Just reach under
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
my desk, Ross; you&#8217;ll find some brandy there. That&#8217;s
it,&#8221; she called, as he produced a bottle. Clutching it
eagerly, she added: &#8220;They say it&#8217;s poison, but it&#8217;s my meat
to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was, in truth, very pale, and her hands were trembling
in a weakness that went to her daughter&#8217;s heart.
Lee admired her bravery, her manlike readiness of action,
but her words, her manner (now that the stress of the
battle was over), hurt and shamed her. Little remained
of the woman in Lize, and the old sheep-herder eyed her
with furtive curiosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was afraid you&#8217;d shoot,&#8221; Lize explained to Ross,
&#8220;and I didn&#8217;t want you to muss up your hands on the
dirty loafers. I had the right to kill; they were trespassers,
and I&#8217;d &#8216;a&#8217; done it, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think they intended to actually assault me,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;but it&#8217;s a bit discouraging to find the town so
indifferent over both the breaking of the laws and the
doings of a drunken mob. I&#8217;m afraid the most of them
are a long way from law-abiding people yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe, who did not like the position in which he stood as
respecting Lee, here made an offer of aid. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
suppose my word is any good now, but if you&#8217;ll let me
do it I&#8217;ll go out and round up Judge Higley. I think I
know where he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>To this Lize objected. &#8220;You can&#8217;t do that, Ross; you
better hold the fort right here till morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee was rather sorry, too, for young Gregg, who bore
his buffeting with the imperturbable face of the heroes
of his class. He had gone into this enterprise with much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
the same spirit in which he had stolen gates and misplaced
signs during his brief college career, and he was now
disposed (in the presence of a pretty girl) to carry it out
with undiminished impudence. &#8220;It only means a fine,
anyway,&#8221; he assured himself.</p>
<p>Cavanagh did not trust Gregg, either, and as this was
the first time he had been called upon to arrest men for
killing game out of season, he could not afford to fail of
any precaution. Tired and sleepy as he was, he must
remain on guard. &#8220;But you and your daughter must go
to bed at once,&#8221; he urged.</p>
<p>Lize, under the spur of her dram, talked on with bitter
boldness. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to get out o&#8217; this town as soon as
I can sell. I won&#8217;t live in it a minute longer than I have
to. It used to have men into it; now they&#8217;re only hobos.
It&#8217;s neither the old time nor the new; it&#8217;s just a betwixt
and between, with a lot o&#8217; young cubs like Joe Gregg
pretendin&#8217; to be tough. I never thought I&#8217;d be sighin&#8217;
for horse-cars, but these rowdy chumps like Neill Ballard
give me a pain. Not one of &#8217;em has sand enough to pull
a gun in the open, but they&#8217;d plug you from a dark alley
or fire out of a crowd. It was different in the old days.
I&#8217;ve seen men walk out into that street, face each other,
and open fire quiet as molasses. But now it&#8217;s all talk and
blow. The <i>men</i> have all grown old or got out.&#8221;</p>
<p>To this Gregg listened with expressionless visage, his
eyes dreamily fixed on Lee&#8217;s face; but his companion, the
old herder, seemed to palpitate with shame and fear.
And Ross had the feeling at the moment that in this
ragged, unkempt old hobo was the skeleton of one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
the old-time heroes. He was wasted with drink and
worn by wind and rain, but he was very far from being
commonplace. &#8220;Here they come again!&#8221; called Lize,
as the hurry of feet along the walk threatened another
attack. Ross Cavanagh again drew his revolver and
stood at guard, and Lize recovering her own weapon
took a place by his side.</p>
<p>With the strength of a bear the new assailant shook
the bolted door. &#8220;Let me in!&#8221; he roared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to hell!&#8221; replied Lize, calmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s dad!&#8221; called young Gregg. &#8220;Go away, you
chump.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me in or I&#8217;ll smash this door!&#8221; retorted Gregg.</p>
<p>&#8220;You smash that door, old Bullfrog,&#8221; announced
Lize, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll carry one of your lungs away. I know
your howl&mdash;it don&#8217;t scare me. I&#8217;ve stood off one whole
mob to-night, and I reckon I&#8217;m good for you. If you
want to get in here you hunt up the judge of this town
and the constable.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a pause Sam called, &#8220;Are you there, son?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet he is,&#8221; responded Lize, &#8220;and here he&#8217;ll stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe added: &#8220;And you&#8217;d better take the lady&#8217;s advice,
pop. She has the drop on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old rancher muttered a fierce curse while Ross
explained the situation. &#8220;I&#8217;m as eager to get rid of
these culprits as any one can be, but they must be taken
by proper authority. Bring a writ from the magistrate
and you may have them and welcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gregg went away without further word, and Lize
said: &#8220;He&#8217;ll find Higley if he&#8217;s in town; and he <i>is</i> in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
town, for I saw him this afternoon. He&#8217;s hiding out
to save himself trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee Virginia, with an understanding of what the
ranger had endured, asked: &#8220;Can&#8217;t I get you something
to eat? Would you like some coffee?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would, indeed,&#8221; he answered, and his tone pleased
her.</p>
<p>She hurried away to get it while Cavanagh disposed
his prisoners behind a couple of tables in the corner.
&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re in for a night of it,&#8221; he remarked, grimly.
&#8220;So make yourselves as comfortable as you can. Perhaps
your experience may be a discouragement to others
of your kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee returned soon with a pot of fresh coffee and some
sandwiches, the sight of which roused young Gregg to
impudent remark. &#8220;Well, notice that! And we&#8217;re left
out!&#8221; But Edwards shrank into the shadow, as if the
light hurt him.</p>
<p>Ross thanked Lee formally, but there was more than
gratitude in his glance, and she turned away to hide her
face from other eyes. Strange place it was for the
blooming of love&#8217;s roses, but they were in her cheeks as
she faced her mother; and Lize, with fresh acknowledgment
of her beauty, broke out again: &#8220;Well, this settles
it. I&#8217;m going to get out of this town, dearie. I&#8217;m done.
This ends the cattle country for me. I don&#8217;t know how
I&#8217;ve put up with these yapps all these years. I&#8217;ve been
robbed and insulted and spit upon just long enough.
I won&#8217;t have you dragged into this mess. I ought to
have turned you back the day you landed here.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>The old man in the corner was listening, straining his
attention in order to catch every word she uttered, and
Ross again caught a gleam in his eyes which puzzled
him. Before he had time to turn his wonder over in
his mind they all caught the sound of feet along the
walk, but this time the sound was sedate and regular,
like the movement of police.</p>
<p>Both prisoners rose to their feet as Cavanagh again
stood alert. The feet halted; a sharp rap sounded on
the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; demanded Lize.</p>
<p>&#8220;The law!&#8221; replied a wheezy voice. &#8220;Open in the
name of the law!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s old Higley,&#8221; announced Lize. &#8220;Open the door,
Ross.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, Law,&#8221; she called, ironically, as the justice
appeared. &#8220;You look kind of mice-eaten, but you&#8217;re all
the law this blame town can sport. Come in and do your
duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Higley (a tall man, with a rusty brown beard, very
much on his dignity) entered the room, followed by a
short, bullet-headed citizen in a rumpled blue suit with
a big star on his breast. Behind on the sidewalk Ballard
and a dozen of his gang could be seen. Sam Gregg,
the moving cause of this resurrection of law and order,
followed the constable, bursting out big curses upon his
son. &#8220;You fool,&#8221; he began, &#8220;I warned you not to monkey
with them sheep. You&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Higley had the grace to stop that. &#8220;Let up on the
cuss-words, Sam; there are ladies present,&#8221; said he, nodding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
toward Lee. Then he opened upon Cavanagh.
&#8220;Well, sir, what&#8217;s all this row? What&#8217;s your charge
against these men?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Killing mountain sheep. I caught them with the
head of a big ram upon their pack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make him show his commission,&#8221; shouted Gregg.
&#8220;He&#8217;s never been commissioned. He&#8217;s no game warden.&#8221;</p>
<p>Higley hemmed. &#8220;I&mdash;ah&mdash;Oh, his authority is all
right, Sam; I&#8217;ve seen it. If he can prove that these men
killed the sheep, we&#8217;ll have to act.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh briefly related how he had captured the
men on the trail. &#8220;The head of the ram is at the livery
barn with my horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about that?&#8221; asked Higley, turning to Joe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s right,&#8221; replied the insolent youth.
&#8220;We killed the sheep all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Higley was in a corner. He didn&#8217;t like to offend
Gregg, and yet the case was plain. He met the issue
blandly. &#8220;Marshal, take these men into custody!&#8221;
Then to Ross: &#8220;We&#8217;ll relieve you of their care, Mr.
Cavanagh. You may appear to-morrow at nine.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a farcical ending to a very arduous thirty-six-hour
campaign, and Ross, feeling like a man who, having
rolled a huge stone to the top of a hill, has been ordered
to drop it, said, &#8220;I insist on the maximum penalty of the
law, Justice Higley, especially for this man!&#8221; He indicated
Joe Gregg.</p>
<p>&#8220;No more sneaking, Higley,&#8221; added Lize, uttering
her distrust in blunt phrase. &#8220;You put these men
through or I&#8217;ll make you trouble.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>Higley turned, and with unsteady solemnity saluted.
&#8220;Fear not my government, madam,&#8221; said he, and so
made exit.</p>
<p>After the door had closed behind them, Cavanagh
bitterly complained. &#8220;I&#8217;ve delivered my prisoners over
into the hands of their friends. I feel like a fool. What
assurance have I that they will ever be punished?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have Higley&#8217;s word,&#8221; retorted Lize, with ironic
inflection. &#8220;He&#8217;ll fine &#8217;em as much as ten dollars apiece,
and confiscate the head, which is worth fifty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter what happens now, you&#8217;ve done your
duty,&#8221; added Lee Virginia, with intent to comfort him.</p>
<p>Lize, now that the stress of the battle was over, fell
a-tremble. &#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ll have to go to bed,&#8221; she admitted.
&#8220;I&#8217;m all in. This night service is wearing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross was alarmed at the sudden droop of her head.
&#8220;Lean on me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s my turn to be useful.&#8221;</p>
<p>She apologized. &#8220;I can&#8217;t stand what I could once,&#8221;
she confessed, as he aided her into the hotel part of the
building. &#8220;It&#8217;s my nerve&mdash;seem&#8217;s like it&#8217;s all gone. I
go to pieces like a sick girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did, indeed, resemble the wreck of a woman as she
lay out upon her bed, her hands twitching, her eyes closed,
and Ross was profoundly alarmed. &#8220;You need the doctor,&#8221;
he urged. &#8220;Let me bring him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, huskily, but with decision, &#8220;I&#8217;m only
tired&mdash;I&#8217;ll be all right soon. Send the people away;
tell &#8217;em to go to bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>For half an hour Cavanagh remained in the room
waiting to see if the doctor&#8217;s services would be required,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
but at the end of that time, as she had apparently fallen
asleep, he rose and tiptoed out into the hall.</p>
<p>Lee followed, and they faced each other in such intimacy
as the shipwrecked feel after the rescue. The
house was still astir with the feet of those to whom the
noises of the night had been a terror or a lure, and their
presence, so far from being a comfort, a protection, filled
the girl&#8217;s heart with fear and disgust. The ranger explained
the outcome of the turmoil, and sent the excited
folk to their beds with the assurance that all was quiet
and that their landlady was asleep.</p>
<p>When they were quite alone Lee said: &#8220;You must not
go out into the streets to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no danger. These hoodlums would not
dare to attack me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevertheless, you shall not go!&#8221; she declared. &#8220;Wait
a moment,&#8221; she commanded, and reentered her mother&#8217;s
room.</p>
<p>As he stood there at Lize Wetherford&#8217;s door, and his
mind went back over her brave deed, which had gone
far to atone for her vulgarity, his respect for her deepened.
Her resolute insistence upon law showed a complete
change of front. &#8220;There is more good in her than I
thought,&#8221; he admitted, and it gave him pleasure, for it
made Lee Virginia&#8217;s character just that much more
dependable. He thrilled with a new and wistful tenderness
as the girl opened the door and stepped out, close
beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her breathing is quieter,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;I think
she&#8217;s going to sleep. It&#8217;s been a terrible night! You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
must be horribly tired. I will find you some place to
sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been a strenuous campaign,&#8221; he admitted.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been practically without sleep for three nights, but
that&#8217;s all in my job. I won&#8217;t mind if Higley will &#8216;soak&#8217;
those fellows properly.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked troubled. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to do about
a bed for you; everything is taken&mdash;except the couch in
the front room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t trouble, I beg of you. I can pitch down anywhere.
I&#8217;m used to hard beds. I must be up early to-morrow,
anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t go till after breakfast,&#8221; she smiled,
wanly, &#8220;I may need you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He understood. &#8220;What did the doctor say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said mother was in a very low state of vitality
and that she must be very careful, which was easy enough
to say. But how can I get her to rest and to diet? You
have seen how little she cares for the doctor&#8217;s orders.
He told her not to touch alcohol.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is more like a man than a woman,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>She led the way into the small sitting-room which lay
at the front of the house, and directly opposite the door
of her own room. It was filled with shabby parlor
furniture, and in one corner stood a worn couch. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sorry, but I can offer nothing better,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Every
bed is taken, but I have plenty of blankets.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was something delightfully suggestive in being
thus waited upon by a young and handsome woman,
and the ranger submitted to it with the awkward grace of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
one unaccustomed to feminine care. The knowledge
that the girl was beneath him in birth, and that she
was considered to be (in a sense) the lovely flower of
a corrupt stock, made the manifest innocency of her
voice and eyes the more appealing. He watched her
moving about the room with eyes in which a furtive
flame glowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;This seems a long way from that dinner at Redfield&#8217;s,
doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he remarked, as she turned from
spreading the blankets on the couch.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is another world,&#8221; she responded, and her face
took on a musing gravity.</p>
<p>Then they faced each other in silence, each filled with
the same delicious sense of weakness, of danger, reluctant
to say good-night, longing for the closer touch which
dawning love demanded, and yet&mdash;something in the girl
defended her, defeated him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must call me if I can be of any help,&#8221; he repeated,
and his voice was tremulous with feeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do so,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>Still they did not part. His voice was very tender
as he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like to see you exposed to such experiences.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was not afraid&mdash;only for you a little,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Redfields like you. Eleanor told me she would
gladly help you. Why do you stay here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot leave my mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure of your duty in that regard. She
got on without you for ten years. You have a right to
consider yourself. You don&#8217;t belong here.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Neither do you,&#8221; she retorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes, I do&mdash;at least, the case is different with me;
my work is here. It hurts me to think of going back
to the hills, leaving you here in the midst of these
wolves.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was talking now in the low, throbbing utterance
of a man carried out of himself. &#8220;It angers me to
think that the worst of these loafers, these drunken
beasts, can glare at you&mdash;can speak to you. They have
no right to breathe the same air with one like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not smile at this; his voice, his eyes were filled
with the gravity of the lover whose passion is not humorous.
Against his training, his judgment, he was being
drawn into closer and closer union with this daughter
of violence, and he added: &#8220;You may not see me in the
morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not go without seeing my mother. You
must have your breakfast with us. It hurt us to think
you didn&#8217;t come to us for supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her words meant little, but the look in her eyes, the
music in her voice, made him shiver. He stammered:
&#8220;I&mdash;I must return to my duties to-morrow. I should
go back to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t do that. You can&#8217;t do that. You are
to appear before the judge.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled. &#8220;That is true. I&#8217;d forgotten that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Radiant with relief, she extended her hand. &#8220;Good-night,
then. You must sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took her hand and drew her toward him, then
perceiving both wonder and fear in her eyes, he conquered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
himself. &#8220;Good-night,&#8221; he repeated, dropping
her hand, but his voice was husky with its passion.</p>
<p>Tired as he was, the ranger could not compose himself
to sleep. The memory of the girl&#8217;s sweet face, the
look of half-surrender in her eyes, the knowledge that
she loved him, and that she was lying but a few yards
from him, made slumber impossible. At the moment
she seemed altogether admirable, entirely worthy to be
won.</p>

<h2>IX</h2>
<h3>THE OLD SHEEP-HERDER</h3>
</div>

<p>The ranger was awakened in the first faint dawn by
the passing of the girl&#8217;s light feet as she went across the
hall to her mother&#8217;s room, and a moment later he heard
the low murmur of her voice. Throwing off his blankets
and making such scant toilet as he needed, he stepped
into the hall and waited for her to return.</p>
<p>Soon she came toward him, a smile of confidence and
pleasure on her lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is she?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite comfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221; His voice was very tender.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a little tired,&#8221; she acknowledged. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
sleep very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t sleep at all,&#8221; he declared, regretfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh yes, I did,&#8221; she replied, brightly.</p>
<p>She appeared a little pale but by no means worn.
Indeed, her face had taken on new charm with its confession
of feminine weakness, its expression of trust in
him.</p>
<p>These two ardent souls confronted each other in absorbed
silence with keener perception, with new daring,
with new intimacy, till he recalled himself with effort.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
&#8220;You must let me help you if there&#8217;s anything I can do.
Remember, I&#8217;m your big brother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember,&#8221; she answered, smilingly, &#8220;and I&#8217;m
going out to see what my big brother is to have for
breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh found the street empty, silent, and utterly
commonplace. And as he walked past Halsey&#8217;s saloon
the tumult of the night seemed born of a vision in disordered
sleep&mdash;and yet it had happened! From these
reeking little dens a score of foul tatterdemalions had
issued, charged with malicious fury. Each of these
shacks seemed the lurking-place of a species of malevolent
insect whose sting was out for every comer.</p>
<p>The rotting sidewalks, the tiny shops, with their dusty
fly-specked windows, the groggeries, from whose open
doors a noisome vapor streamed, poisoning the morning
air&mdash;all these typed the old-time West as Redfield and
his farmstead typed the new.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once I would have laughed at this town,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;but now it is disgusting&mdash;something to be wiped out
as one expunges an obscene mark upon a public wall.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the attack upon himself, terrifying as it had
seemed to Lee Virginia, it was in reality only another
lively episode in the history of the town, another disagreeable
duty in the life of a ranger. It was all a part
of his job.</p>
<p>He went forth to his duties with a deepened conviction
of the essential lawlessness of the State and of
America in general; for this spirit of mob law was to be
found in some form throughout the land. He was disgusted,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
but not beaten. His resolution to carry out the
terms of his contract with the Government remained unshaken.</p>
<p>He carried with him, also, a final disturbing glimpse
of Eliza Wetherford&#8217;s girl that did indeed threaten his
peace of mind. There was an involuntary appeal, a
wistful depth, to her glance which awakened in him an
indignant pity, and also blew into flame something not
so creditable&mdash;something which smoldered beneath his
conscious will. He perceived in her a spirit of yielding
which was difficult to resist. He understood, much more
clearly than at his first meeting with her, how impossible
it was for her to remain in this country (where law was
a joke and women a ribald jest) without being corrupted.
She had not escaped her heritage of passion, and her
glances, innocent as they were, roused, even in him,
something lawless.</p>
<p>As he climbed the long hill he grappled deeply with this
new and inexplicable weakness. He had always been a
decent fellow as respects women, and had maintained the
same regard for the moral code that he instinctively bore
toward the laws of his adopted country. He could not,
therefore, regard this girl (low as her parentage seemed)
in the light of license; for (he thought) whatever of evil
may have been planted deep in her nature by her ill-assorted
father and mother, she is at the moment sweet
and fine, and the man who would awaken her other
self should be accursed.</p>
<p>In this mood, too, he acknowledged the loneliness of his
life for the first time, and rode his silent way up the trail
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
like one in a dream. He went over his life story in detail,
wondering if he had not made a mistake in leaving
England, in taking out his American citizenship. He
considered again, very seriously, the question of going
back to live on the estate of his mother, and once more
decided that its revenue was too small. To return to it
meant an acceptance of the restricted life of an English
farmer, and, worst of all, an acquiescence in the social
despotism which he had come to feel and to hate.</p>
<p>The English empire to him was falling apart. Its
supremacy was already threatened by Germany, whereas
the future of the States appealed to his imagination.
Here the problems of popular government and of industry
were to be worked out on the grandest scale. The
West inspired him. &#8220;Some day each of these great
ranges will be a national forest, and each of these canons
will contain its lake, its reservoir.&#8221; There was something
fine in this vision of man&#8217;s conquest of nature.
&#8220;Surely in this development there is a place for me,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>Start at any place he pleased, his mind circled and came
back to Lee Virginia. He reproached himself for not
having remained one more day to help her. She was
in the midst of a most bleak and difficult pass, and
whether she came through or not depended on something
not derived from either her father or her mother. The
test of her character was being made.</p>
<p>&#8220;Happily the father is dead, and his exploits fading to
a dim legend; but the mother may live for years to dishearten
and corrupt. It is foolish of the girl to stay, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
yet to have her go would leave me and the whole valley
poorer.&#8221;</p>
<p>He perceived in her a symbol. &#8220;She is the new West
just as the mother represents the old, and the law of inheritance
holds in her as it holds in the State. She is a
mixture of good and evil, of liberty and license. She
must still draw forward, for a time, the dead weight of
her past, just as the West must bear with and gradually
slough off its violent moods.&#8221;</p>
<p>His pony plodded slowly, and the afternoon was half-spent
before he came in sight of the long, low log-cabin
which was the only home he possessed in all America. For
the first time since he built it, the station seemed lonely
and disheartening. &#8220;Would any woman, for love of me,
come to such a hearthstone?&#8221; he asked himself. &#8220;And
if she consented to do so, could I be so selfish as to exact
such sacrifice? No, the forest ranger in these attitudes
must be young and heart-free; otherwise his life would
be miserably solitary.&#8221;</p>
<p>He unsaddled his horse and went about his duties with
a leaden pall over his spirit, a fierce turmoil in his brain.
He was no longer single-hearted in his allegiance to
the forest. He could not banish that appealing girlish
face, that trusting gaze. Lee Virginia needed him as
he needed her; and yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;the people&#8217;s lands
demanded his care, his social prejudices forbade his
marriage.</p>
<p>He was just dishing out his rude supper when the feet
of a horse on the log bridge announced a visitor.</p>
<p>With a feeling of pleasure as well as relief, he rose to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
greet the stranger. &#8220;Any visitor is welcome this night,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>The horseman proved to be his former prisoner, the
old man Edwards, who slipped from his saddle with the
never-failing grace of the cow-man, and came slowly
toward the cabin. He smiled wearily as he said: &#8220;I&#8217;m
on your trail, Mr. Ranger, but I bear no malice. You
were doing your duty. Can you tell me how far it is to
Ambro&#8217;s camp?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was something forlorn in the man&#8217;s attitude, and
Cavanagh&#8217;s heart softened. &#8220;Turn your horse into the
corral and come to supper,&#8221; he commanded, with Western
bluntness; &#8220;we&#8217;ll talk about all that later.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edwards accepted his hospitality without hesitation,
and when he had disposed of his mount and made himself
ready for the meal, he came in and took a seat at the
table in silence, while the ranger served him and waited
for his explanation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going up to take Ambro&#8217;s place,&#8221; he began, after a
few minutes of silent eating. &#8220;Know where his camp is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; replied Ross, to whom the stranger now appeared
in pathetic guise. &#8220;Any man of his age consenting
to herd sheep is surely hard hit by the rough hand
of the world,&#8221; he reasoned, and the closer he studied his
visitor the plainlier he felt his ungoverned past. His
chest was hollow, his eyes unnaturally large, and his
hands thin, but he still displayed faint lines of the beauty
and power he had once gloried in. His clothing was
worn and poor, and Ross said: &#8220;You&#8217;ll need plenty of
bedding up there.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is it high?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About eleven thousand feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jehosaphat! How will I stand that kind of air?
Still, it may be it&#8217;s what I need. I&#8217;ve been living down in
the low country for ten years, and I&#8217;m a little bit hide-bound.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lung trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no; old age, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not old&mdash;not more than fifty-five.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no colt,&#8221; he admitted; &#8220;and, besides, I&#8217;ve lived
pretty swift.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this was the hint of a confession, but Cavanagh did
not care to have him proceed further in that line. &#8220;I
suppose Gregg paid your fine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In any other town in the State you&#8217;d have gone down
the line.&#8221;</p>
<p>He roused himself. &#8220;See here, Mr. Ranger, you&#8217;ve
no warrant to believe me, but I told you the God&#8217;s truth.
Young Gregg got me to ride into the range and show
him the trail. I didn&#8217;t intend to get mixed up
with a game warden. I&#8217;ve had all the confinement I
need.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a closed incident now,&#8221; interposed Ross;
&#8220;we won&#8217;t reopen it. Make yourself at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stranger, hungry as he was, ate with unexpected
gentility, and, as the hot coffee sent its cheerful glow
through his body, he asked, with livening interest, a
good many questions about the ranger and the Forest
Service. &#8220;You fellers have to be all-round men. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
cowboys think you have a snap, but I guess you earn
your money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A man that builds trail, lays bridges, burns brush,
fights fire, rides the round-up, and covers seventy-five
miles of trail every week on eighty dollars per month,
and feeds himself and his horses, isn&#8217;t what I would call
enjoying a soft snap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you do it for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God knows! I&#8217;ve been asking myself that question
all day to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This playin&#8217; game warden has some outs, too. That
was a wild crowd last night. The town is the same old
hell-hole it was when I knew it years ago. Fine girl of
Lize Wetherford&#8217;s. She blocked <i>me</i> all right.&#8221; He
smiled wanly. &#8220;I certainly was on my way to the
green timber when she put the bars up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross made no comment, and the other went on, in a
tone of reminiscent sadness. &#8220;Lize has changed terribly.
I used to know her when she was a girl. Judas
Priest! but she could ride and shoot in those days!&#8221;
His eyes kindled with the memory of her. &#8220;She could
back a horse to beat any woman that ever crossed the
range, but I didn&#8217;t expect to see her have such a skein
of silk as that girl. She sure looks the queen to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh did not greatly relish this line of conversation,
but the pause enabled him to say: &#8220;Miss Wetherford
is not much Western; she got her training in the
East. She&#8217;s been with an aunt ever since her father&#8217;s
death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dead, is he?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So far as anybody knows, he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s no loss. I knew him, too. He was all
kinds of a fool; let a few slick ones seduce him with
fizz-water and oysters on the half-shell&mdash;that&#8217;s the kind
of a weak sister he was. He got on the wrong side of
the rustler line-up&mdash;you know all about that, I reckon?
Fierce old days, those. We didn&#8217;t know anything about
forest rangers or game wardens in them days.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stranger&#8217;s tone was now that of a man quite certain
of himself. He had become less furtive under the
influence of the food and fire.</p>
<p>Ross defended Wetherford for Virginia&#8217;s sake. &#8220;He
wasn&#8217;t altogether to blame, as I see it. He was the
Western type in full flower, that&#8217;s all. He had to go
like the Indian and the buffalo. And these hobos like
Ballard and Gregg will go next.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edwards sank back into his chair. &#8220;I reckon that&#8217;s
right,&#8221; he agreed, and made offer to help clear away the
supper dishes.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re tired,&#8221; replied Ross; &#8220;rest and smoke.
I&#8217;ll soon be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>The poacher each moment seemed less of the hardened
criminal, and more and more of the man prematurely
aged by sickness and dissipation, and gradually the
ranger lost all feeling of resentment.</p>
<p>As he sat down beside the fire, Edwards said:
&#8220;Them Wetherford women think a whole lot of you.
&#8217;Pears like they&#8217;d both fight for you. Are you sweet on
the girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, see here, old man,&#8221; Ross retorted, sharply,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
&#8220;you want to do a lot of thinking before you comment
on Miss Wetherford. I won&#8217;t stand for any nasty
clack.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edwards meekly answered: &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t going to say
anything out of the way. I was fixin&#8217; for to praise her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the same, I don&#8217;t intend to discuss her with you,&#8221;
was Cavanagh&#8217;s curt answer.</p>
<p>The herder fell back into silence while the ranger prepared
his bunk for the night. The fact that he transferred
some of the blankets from his own bed to that of
his visitor did not escape Edwards&#8217;s keen eyes, and with
grateful intent he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I can give you a tip, Mr. Ranger,&#8221; said he, breaking
out of a silence. &#8220;The triangle outfit is holding more
cattle on the forest than their permits call for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard one of the boys braggin&#8217; about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Much obliged,&#8221; responded Ross. &#8220;I&#8217;ll look into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edwards went on: &#8220;Furthermore, they&#8217;re fixing for
another sheep-kill over there, too; all the sheepmen are
armed. That&#8217;s why I left the country. I don&#8217;t want to
run any more chances of being shot up. I&#8217;ve had enough
of trouble; I can&#8217;t afford to be hobnobbing with judges
and juries.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When does your parole end?&#8221; asked Ross.</p>
<p>Edwards forced a grin. &#8220;I was handing you one
when I said that,&#8221; he declared, weakly. &#8220;I was workin&#8217;
up sympathy. I&#8217;m not out on parole; I&#8217;m just a broken-down
old cow-puncher herdin&#8217; sheep in order to keep
clear of the liquor belt.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>This seemed reasonable, and the ranger remarked, by
way of dropping the subject: &#8220;I&#8217;ve nothing to say further
than this&mdash;obey the rules of the forest, and you won&#8217;t
get into any further trouble with me. And as for
being shot up by the cow-men, you&#8217;ll not be disturbed
on any national forest. There never has been
a single herder shot nor a sheep destroyed on this
forest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m mighty glad to hear that,&#8221; replied Edwards, with
sincere relief. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had my share of shooting up and
shooting down. All I ask now is quiet and the society
of sheep. I take a kind of pleasure in protecting the
fool brutes. It&#8217;s about all I&#8217;m good for.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did, indeed, look like a man in the final year of life
as he spoke. &#8220;Better turn in,&#8221; he said, in kindlier tone;
&#8220;I&#8217;m an early riser.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old fellow rose stiffly, and, laying aside his boots
and trousers, rolled into his bunk and was asleep in
three minutes.</p>
<p>Cavanagh himself was very tired, and went to bed soon
after, to sleep dreamlessly till daylight. He sprang from
his bed, and after a plunge in the stream set about breakfast;
while Edwards rose from his bunk, groaning and
sighing, and went forth to wrangle the horses, rubbing
his hands and shivering as he met the keen edge of the
mountain wind. When he returned, breakfast was
ready, and again he expressed his gratitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you any slicker?&#8221; asked Cavanagh. &#8220;It
looks like rain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m run down pretty low,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
truth is, Mr. Ranger, I blew in all my wages at roulette
last week.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross brought out a canvas coat, well worn but serviceable.
&#8220;Take this along with you. It&#8217;s likely to storm
before we reach the sheep-camp. And you don&#8217;t look
very strong. You must take care of yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edwards was visibly moved by this kindness. &#8220;Sure
you can spare it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certain sure; I&#8217;ve another,&#8221; returned the ranger,
curtly.</p>
<p>It was hardly more than sunrise as they mounted their
ponies and started on their trail, which led sharply upward
after they left the canon. The wind was strong
and stinging cold. Over the high peaks the gray-black
vapor was rushing, and farther away a huge dome of
cloud was advancing like an army in action. It was all
in the day&#8217;s work of the ranger, but the plainsman behind
him turned timorous eyes toward the sky. &#8220;It
looks owly,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know I was going
so high&mdash;Gregg didn&#8217;t say the camp was so near timber-line.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve cut out a lonesome job for yourself,&#8221; Ross
assured him, &#8220;and if you can find anything else to do
you&#8217;d better give this up and go back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m used to being lonesome,&#8221; the stranger said,
&#8220;but I can&#8217;t stand the cold and the wet as I used to. I
never was a mountaineer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taking pity on the shivering man, Cavanagh turned
off the trail into a sheltered nook behind some twisted
pine-trees. &#8220;How do you expect to take care of your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
sheep a thousand feet higher than this?&#8221; he demanded
as they entered the still place, where the sun shone
warm.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m asking myself,&#8221; replied Edwards.
He slipped from his horse and crouched close to the
rock. &#8220;My blood is mostly ditch-water, seems like.
The wind blows right through me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you happen to be reduced to herding sheep?
You look like a man who has seen better days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edwards, chafing his thin fingers to warm them,
made reluctant answer: &#8220;It&#8217;s a long story, Mr. Ranger,
and it concerns a whole lot of other people&mdash;some of
them decent folks&mdash;so I&#8217;d rather not go into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;John Barleycorn was involved, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing&mdash;he&#8217;s generally always in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better take my gloves&mdash;it&#8217;s likely to snow in
half an hour. Go ahead&mdash;I&#8217;m a younger man than you
are.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other made a decent show of resistance, but
finally accepted the offer, saying: &#8220;You certainly are
white to me. I want to apologize for making that attempt
to sneak away that night&mdash;I had a powerful good
reason for not staying any longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross smiled a little. &#8220;You showed bad judgment&mdash;as
it turned out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure did. That girl can shoot. Her gun was
steady as a door-knob. She filled the door. Where did
she learn to hold a gun like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her father taught her, so she said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She wouldn&#8217;t remember me&mdash;an old cuss like me&mdash;but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
I&#8217;ve seen her with Wetherford when she was a kidlet.
I never thought she&#8217;d grow up into such a &#8216;queen.&#8217;
She&#8217;s a wonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Strange to say, Ross no longer objected to the old
man&#8217;s words of admiration; on the contrary, he encouraged
him to talk on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her courage is greater than you know. When she
came to that hotel it was a place of dirt and vermin.
She has transformed it. She&#8217;s now engaged on the reformation
of her mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lize was straight when I knew her,&#8221; remarked the
other, in the tone of one who wishes to defend a memory.
&#8220;Straight as a die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In certain ways she&#8217;s straight now, but she&#8217;s been
hard pushed at times, and has traded in liquor to help
out&mdash;then she&#8217;s naturally a slattern.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t used to be,&#8221; asserted Edwards; &#8220;she
was a mighty handsome woman when I used to see her
riding around with Ed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s down at the heel now, quite like the town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She looked sick to me. You shouldn&#8217;t be too hard
on a sick woman, but she ought to send her girl away or
get out. As you say, the Fork is no kind of a place for
such a girl. If I had a son, a fine young feller like that
girl is, do you suppose I&#8217;d let him load himself up with
an old soak like me? No, sir; Lize has no right to spoil
that girl&#8217;s life. I&#8217;m nothing but a ham-strung old cow-puncher,
but I&#8217;ve too much pride to saddle my pack
on the shoulders of my son the way Lize seems to be
doin&#8217; with that girl.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>He spoke with a good deal of feeling, and the ranger
studied him with deepening interest. He had taken on
dignity in the heat of his protest, and in his eyes blazed
something that was both manly and admirable.</p>
<p>Cavanagh took his turn at defending Lize. &#8220;As a
matter of fact, she tried to send her daughter away, but
Lee refuses to go, insisting that it is her duty to remain.
In spite of her bad blood the girl is surprisingly true and
sweet. She makes me wonder whether there is as much
in heredity as we think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her blood ain&#8217;t so bad. Wetherford was a fool and
a daredevil, but he came of good Virginia stock&mdash;so
I&#8217;ve heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, whatever was good in both sire and dame this
girl seems to have mysteriously gathered to herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man looked at him with a bright sidelong
glance. &#8220;You are a little sweet on the girl, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross began to regret his confidence. &#8220;She&#8217;s making a
good fight, and I feel like helping her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And she rather likes being helped by you. I could
see that when she brought the coffee to you. She likes
to stand close&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross cut him short. &#8220;We&#8217;ll not discuss her any
further.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean any harm, Mr. Ranger; we hobos have
a whole lot of time to gossip, and I&#8217;m old enough to like
a nice girl in a fatherly way. I reckon the whole valley
rides in to see her, just the way you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh winced. &#8220;You can&#8217;t very well hide a handsome
woman in a cattle country.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>Edwards smiled again, sadly. &#8220;Not in my day you
couldn&#8217;t. Why, a girl like that would &#8216;a&#8217; been worth a
thousand head o&#8217; steers. I&#8217;ve seen a man come in with
a span of mules and three ordinary female daughters,
and without cinching a saddle to a pony accumulate five
thousand cattle.&#8221; Then he grew grave again. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
happen to have a picture of the girl, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I did, would I show it to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might. You might even give it to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh looked at the man as if he were dreaming.
&#8220;You must be crazy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no, I&#8217;m not. Sheep-herders do go twisted, but
I&#8217;m not in the business long enough for that. I&#8217;m just
a bit nutty about that girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused a moment. &#8220;So if you have a picture, I wish
you&#8217;d show it to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. I&#8217;ve only seen her two or three times,
and she isn&#8217;t the kind that distributes her favors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it seems. And yet you&#8217;re just the kind of figure
to catch a girl&#8217;s eye. She likes you&mdash;I could see that, but
you&#8217;ve got a good opinion of yourself. You&#8217;re an educated
man&mdash;do you intend to marry her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Mr. Sheep-herder, you better ride on up to
your camp,&#8221; and Ross turned to mount his horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; called the other man, and his voice
surprised the ranger with a note of authority. &#8220;I was
terribly taken with that girl, and I owe you a whole
lot; but I&#8217;ve got to know one thing. I can see you&#8217;re
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
full of her, and jealous as a bear of any other suitor.
Now I want to know whether you intend to marry her
or whether you&#8217;re just playing with her?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross was angry now. &#8220;What I intend to do is none
of your business.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other man was suddenly ablaze with passion.
His form had lost its stoop. His voice was firm. &#8220;I
merely want to say that if you play the goat with that
girl, I&#8217;ll kill you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross stared at him quite convinced that he had gone
entirely mad. &#8220;That&#8217;s mighty chivalrous of you, Mr.
Sheep-herder,&#8221; he replied, cuttingly; &#8220;but I&#8217;m at a
loss to understand this sudden indignation on your
part.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t be&mdash;I&#8217;m her father!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh fairly reeled before this retort. His head
rang as if he had been struck with a club. He perceived
the truth of the man&#8217;s words instantly. He gasped:
&#8220;Good God, man! are <i>you</i> Ed Wetherford?&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer was quick. &#8220;That&#8217;s who I am!&#8221; Then
his voice changed. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t want the women to
know I&#8217;m alive&mdash;I didn&#8217;t intend to let anybody know it.
My fool temper has played hell with me again&#8221;&mdash;then
his voice grew firmer&mdash;&#8220;all the same, I mean it. If you
or any man tries to abuse her, I&#8217;ll kill him! I&#8217;ve loaded
her up with trouble, as you say, but I&#8217;m going to do
what I can to protect her&mdash;now that I&#8217;m in the county
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross, confused by this new complication in the life of
the girl he was beginning to love, stared at his companion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
in dismay. Was it not enough that Virginia&#8217;s mother
should be a slattern and a termagant? At last he spoke:
&#8220;Where have you been all these years?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the Texas &#8216;pen.&#8217; I served nine years there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shooting a man. It was a case of self-defence, but
his family had more money and influence than I did,
so I went down the road. As soon as I was out I started
north&mdash;just the way a dog will point toward home. I
didn&#8217;t intend to come here, but some way I couldn&#8217;t
keep away. I shied round the outskirts of the Fork,
picking up jobs of sheep-herding just to have time to
turn things over. I know what you&#8217;re thinking about&mdash;you&#8217;re
saying to yourself, &#8216;Well, here&#8217;s a nice father-in-law?&#8217;
Well, now, I don&#8217;t know anything about your
people, but the Wetherfords are as good as anybody.
If I hadn&#8217;t come out into this cursed country, where even
the women go shootin&#8217; wild, I would have been in Congress;
but being hot-headed, I must mix in. I&#8217;m not
excusing myself, you understand; I&#8217;m not a desirable
addition to any man&#8217;s collection of friends, but I can
promise you this&mdash;no one but yourself shall ever know
who I am. At the same time, you can&#8217;t deceive my girl
without my being named in the funeral that will follow.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a singular place for such an exchange of confidences.
Wetherford stood with his back against his
pony, his face flushed, his eyes bright as though part of
his youth had returned to him, while the ranger, slender,
erect, and powerful, faced him with sombre glance.
Overhead the detached clouds swept swift as eagles,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
casting shadows cold as winter, and in the dwarfed century-old
trees the wind breathed a sad monody. Occasionally
the sun shone warm and golden upon the
group, and then it seemed spring, and the far-off plain
a misty sea.</p>
<p>At last Cavanagh said: &#8220;You are only a distant and
romantic figure to Lee&mdash;a part of the dead past. She
remembers you as a bold rider and a wondrously
brave and chivalrous father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does she?&#8221; he asked, eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and she loves to talk of you. She knows the
town&#8217;s folk despise your memory, but that she lays to
prejudice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She must never know. You must promise never to
tell her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I promise that,&#8221; Cavanagh said, and Edwards went
on:</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could bring something to her&mdash;prove to her I&#8217;m
still a man&mdash;it might do to tell her, but I&#8217;m a branded
man now, and an old man, and there&#8217;s no hope for me.
I worked in one of the machine-shops down there, and
it took the life out of me. Then, too, I left a bad name
here in the Fork&mdash;I know that. Those big cattle-men
fooled me into taking their side of the war. I staked
everything I had on them, and then they railroaded me
out of the county. So, you see, I&#8217;m double-crossed, no
matter where I turn.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every word he uttered made more apparent to Cavanagh
that Lee Virginia would derive nothing but pain
and disheartenment from a knowledge that her father
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
lived. &#8220;She must be spared this added burden of shameful
inheritance,&#8221; he decided.</p>
<p>The other man seemed to understand something of the
ranger&#8217;s indignant pity, for he repeated: &#8220;I want you to
<i>swear</i> not to let Lee know I&#8217;m alive, no matter what
comes; she must not be saddled with my record. Let
her go on thinking well of me. Give me your word!&#8221;
He held out an insistent palm.</p>
<p>Ross yielded his hand, and in spite of himself his tenderness
for the broken man deepened. The sky was
darkening to the west, and with a glance upward he said:
&#8220;I reckon we&#8217;d better make your camp soon or you&#8217;ll
be chilled to the bone.&#8221;</p>
<p>They mounted hastily and rode away, each feeling
that his relationship to the other had completely changed.
Wetherford marvelled over the evident culture and refinement
of the ranger. &#8220;He&#8217;s none too good for her,
no matter who he is,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Upon leaving timber-line they entered upon a wide and
sterile slope high on the rocky breast of the great peak,
whose splintered crest lorded the range. Snow-fields lay
all about, and a few hundred feet higher up the canons
were filled with ice. It was a savage and tempest-swept
spot in which to pitch a tent, but there among the rocks
shivered the minute canvas home of the shepherd, and
close beside it, guarded by a lone dog, and lying like
a thick-spread flock of rimy bowlders (almost unnoticeable
in their silent immobility) huddled the
sheep.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s your house,&#8221; shouted Ross to Wetherford.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>The older man, with white face of dismay, looked about
him, unable to make reply.</p>
<p>The walls of the frail teepee, flapping in the breeze,
appeared hardly larger than a kerchief caught upon a
bush, and the disheartened collie seemed nervously apprehensive
of its being utterly swept away. The great
peaks were now hid by the rain, and little could be seen
but wet rocks, twisted junipers, and the trickling gray
streams of icy water. The eastern landscape was naked,
alpine, splendid yet appalling, and the voices of the
sheep added to the dreary message of the scene.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello there!&#8221; shouted Ross, wondering at the absence
of human life about the camp. &#8220;Hello the house!&#8221;</p>
<p>Receiving no answer to his hail, he turned to Wetherford.
&#8220;Looks like Joe has pulled out and left the collie
to &#8217;tend the flock. He&#8217;s been kind o&#8217; seedy for some
days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dismounting, he approached the tent. The collie,
who knew him, seemed to understand his errand, for he
leaped upon him as if to kiss his cheek. Ross put him
down gently. &#8220;You&#8217;re almost too glad to see me, old
fellow. I wonder how long you&#8217;ve been left here alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thereupon he opened the tied flap, but started back
with instant perception of something wrong, for there,
on his pile of ragged quilts, lay the Basque herder, with
flushed face and rolling eyes, crazed with fever and entirely
helpless. &#8220;You&#8217;d better not come in here, Wetherford,&#8221;
Ross warned. &#8220;Joe is here, horribly sick, and
I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s something contagious. It may be
smallpox.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>Wetherford recoiled a step. &#8220;Smallpox! What makes
you think that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, these Basques have been having it over in their
settlement, and, besides, it smells like it.&#8221; He listened
a moment. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid Joe&#8217;s in for it. He&#8217;s crazy with
it. But he&#8217;s a human being, and we can&#8217;t let him die
here alone. You rustle some wood for the stove, and
I&#8217;ll see what I can do for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wetherford was old and wasted and thin-blooded,
but he had never been a coward, and in his heart there
still burned a small flame of his youthful, reckless, generous
daring. Pushing Cavanagh one side, he said,
with firm decision: &#8220;You keep out o&#8217; there. I&#8217;m the
one to play nurse. This is my job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense; I am younger and stronger than you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get away!&#8221; shouted the older man. &#8220;Gregg hired
me to do this work, and it don&#8217;t matter whether I live
or die; but you&#8217;ve got something to do in the world.
My girl needs you, and she don&#8217;t need me, so get out o&#8217;
here and stay out. Go bring me that wood, and I&#8217;ll
go in and see what&#8217;s the matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh looked him in the face an instant. &#8220;Very
well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I&#8217;ll do as you say. There&#8217;s no use of
our both taking chances.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was beginning to rain, and the tent was dark and
desolate, but as the fire in the little stove commenced
to snarl, and the smoke to pour out of the pipe, the
small domicile took on cheer. Wetherford knew how
to care for the sick, and in the shelter of the canvas
wall developed unforeseen vigor and decision. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
amazing to Cavanagh to witness his change of manner.</p>
<p>Soon a pan of water was steaming, and some hot
stones were at the sufferer&#8217;s feet, and when Wetherford
appeared at the door of the tent his face was almost
happy. &#8220;Kill a sheep. There isn&#8217;t a thing but a heel
of bacon and a little flour in the place.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the ranger went about his outside duties he had
time to take into full account the tragic significance of the
situation. He was not afraid of death, but the menace
of sickness under such surroundings made his blood
run cold. It is such moments as these that the wilderness
appalls. Twenty miles of most difficult trail lay
between his own cabin and this spot. To carry the sick
man on his horse would not only be painful to the sufferer
but dangerous to the rescuer, for if the Basque
were really ill of smallpox contagion would surely follow.
On the other hand, to leave him to die here unaided
seemed inhuman, impossible.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is only one thing to do,&#8221; he called to Wetherford,
&#8220;and that is for me to ride back to the station and
bring up some extra bedding and my own tent, and so
camp down beside you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right; but remember I&#8217;ve established a quarantine.
I&#8217;ll crack your head if you break over the line an
inch.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no longer any feeling of reaching up or
reaching down between the two men&mdash;they were equals.
Wetherford, altogether admirable, seemed to have regained
his manhood as he stood in the door of the tent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
confronting the ranger. &#8220;This Basque ain&#8217;t much of
a find, but, as you say, he&#8217;s human, and we can&#8217;t let
him lie here and die, I&#8217;ll stay with him till you can
find a doctor or till he dies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I take off my hat to you,&#8221; responded Cavanagh.
&#8220;You are a man.&#8221;</p>

<h3>THE SMOKE OF THE BURNING</h3>
</div>

<p>The reader will observe that the forest ranger&#8217;s job
is that of a man and a patriot, and such a ranger was
Cavanagh, notwithstanding his foreign birth. He could
ride all day in the saddle and fight fire all night. While not
a trained forester, he was naturally a reader, and thoroughly
understood the theories of the department. As a practical
ranger he stood half-way between the cowboy (who
was at first the only available material) and the trained
expert who is being educated to follow him.</p>
<p>He was loyal with the loyalty of a soldier, and his hero
was the colonel of the Rough-riders, under whom he
had campaigned. The second of his admirations was
the Chief Forester of the department.</p>
<p>The most of us are getting so thin-skinned, so dependent
upon steam-heat and goloshes, that the actions
of a man like this riding forth upon his trail at all hours
of the day and night self-sufficing and serene, seem like
the doings of an epic, and so indeed they are.</p>
<p>On the physical side the plainsman, the cowboy, the
poacher, are all admirable, but Cavanagh went far beyond
their physical hardihood. He dreamed, as he rode,
of his responsibilities. The care of the poor Basque
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
shepherd he had accepted as a matter of routine without
Wetherford&#8217;s revelation of himself, which complicated
an exceedingly pitiful case. He could not forget that it
was Lee Virginia&#8217;s father who stood in danger of contracting
the deadly disease, and as he imagined him
dying far up there on that bleak slope, his heart pinched
with the tragedy of the old man&#8217;s life. In such wise
the days of the ranger were smouldering to this end.</p>
<p>On the backward trail he turned aside to stamp out a
smoking log beside a deserted camp-fire, and again he
made a detour into a lovely little park to visit a fisherman
and to warn him of the danger of fire. He was the forest
guardian, alert to every sign, and yet all the time he was
being drawn on toward his temptation. Why not resign
and go East, taking the girl with him? &#8220;After all, the
life up here is a lonely and hard one, in no sense a
vocation for an ambitious man. Suppose I am promoted
to Forest Supervisor? That only means a little
more salary and life in a small city rather than here.
District Supervisor would be better, but can I hope to
secure such a position?&#8221;</p>
<p>Up to this month he had taken the matter of his promotion
easily; it was something to come along in the
natural course of things. &#8220;There is no haste; I can
wait.&#8221; Now haste seemed imperative. &#8220;I am no
longer so young as I was,&#8221; he admitted.</p>
<p>Once back at his cabin he laid aside his less tangible
problems, and set himself to cooking some food to take
back with him to the peak. He brought in his pack-horse,
and burdened him with camp outfit and utensils,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
and extra clothing. He filled his pockets with such
medicines as he possessed, and so at last, just as night
was falling, he started back over his difficult trail.</p>
<p>The sky was black as the roof of a cavern, for the stars
were hid by a roof of cloud which hung just above his head,
and the ranger was obliged to feel his way through the
first quarter of his journey. The world grew lighter
after he left the canon and entered the dead timber of
the glacial valley, but even in the open the going was
wearisome and the horses proceeded with sullen caution.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Basque is a poor, worthless little peasant, but
he is a human being, and to leave him to die up there
would be monstrous,&#8221; he insisted, as the horses stumbled
upward over the rocks of a vast lateral moraine toward
the summit, blinded by the clouds through which they
were forced to pass. He was dismounted now and picking
his way with a small lantern, whose feeble ray (like
that of a firefly) illuminated for a small space the dripping
rocks; all else was tangible yellow mist which possessed
a sulphurous odor and clung to everything it
touched. The wind had died out entirely, and the
mountain-side was as silent as the moon.</p>
<p>Foot by foot he struggled up the slope, hoping each
moment to break through this blanket of vapor into the
clear air. He knew from many previous experiences
that the open sky existed a little way above, that this was
but a roof.</p>
<p>At last he parted the layer of mist and burst into
the moonlit heights above. He drew a deep breath of
awe as he turned and looked about him. Overhead the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
sky was sparkling with innumerable stars, and the crescent
moon was shining like burnished silver, while level
with his breast rolled a limitless, silent, and mystical
ocean of cloud which broke against the dark peaks in
soundless surf, and spread away to the east in ever-widening
shimmer. All the lesser hills were covered;
only the lords of the range towered above the flood in
sullen and unmoved majesty.</p>
<p>For a long time Cavanagh stood beside his weary
horses, filling his soul with the beauty of this world, so
familiar yet so transformed. He wished for his love;
she would feel and know and rejoice with him. It was
such experiences as these that made him content with
his work. For the ranger Nature plays her profoundest
dramas&mdash;sometimes with the rush of winds, the crash
of thunder; sometimes like this, in silence so deep that
the act of breathing seems a harsh, discordant note.</p>
<p>Slowly the mystic waters fell away, sinking with slightly
rolling action into the valleys, and out of the wool-white
waves sudden sharp dark forms upthrust like
strange masters of the deep. Towers took shape and
islands upheaved, crowned with dark fortresses. To the
west a vast and inky-black Gibraltar magically appeared.
Soon the sea was but a prodigious river flowing
within the high walls of an ancient glacier, a ghost
of the icy stream that once ground its slow way between
these iron cliffs.</p>
<p>With a shudder of awe the ranger turned from the
intolerable beauty of this combination of night, cloud,
and mountain-crest, and resumed his climb. Such scenes,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
by their majesty, their swift impermanency, their colossal
and heedless haste, made his heart ache with indefinable
regret. Again and again he looked back, longing for
some power which would enable him to record and reproduce
for the eyes of his love some part of this stupendous
and noiseless epic. He was no longer content
to enjoy Nature&#8217;s splendors alone.</p>
<p>On the cold and silent side of the great divide the
faint light of the shepherd&#8217;s teepee shone, and with a
returning sense of his duty to his fellows on the roof of
the continent, Cavanagh pushed onward.</p>
<p>Wetherford met him at the door, no longer the poor
old tramp, but a priest, one who has devoted himself to
Christ&#8217;s service.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is he?&#8221; asked the ranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Delirious,&#8221; replied the herder. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had to hold
him to his bed. I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve come. It&#8217;s lonesome
up here. Don&#8217;t come too near. Set your tent down
there by the trees. I can&#8217;t have you infected. Keep
clear of me and this camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got some food and some extra clothing for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Put &#8217;em down here, and in the morning drive these
sheep away. That noise disturbs the dago, and I don&#8217;t
like it myself; they sound lonesome and helpless.
That dog took &#8217;em away for a while, but brought &#8217;em
back again; poor devil, he don&#8217;t know what to think
of it all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross did as Wetherford commanded him to do, and
withdrew a little way down the slope; and without putting
up his tent, rolled himself in his blankets and went to sleep.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>The sun rose gloriously. With mountain fickleness
the wind blew gently from the east, the air was precisely
like late March, and the short and tender grass,
the small flowers in the sheltered corners of the rocks,
and the multitudinous bleatings of the lambs were all in
keeping. It was spring in the world and it was spring
in the heart of the ranger, in spite of all his perplexities.
The Basque would recover, the heroic ex-convict would
not be stricken, and all would be well. Of such resiliency
is the heart of youth.</p>
<p>His first duty was to feed the faithful collie, and to send
him forth with the flock. His next was to build a fire
and cook some breakfast for Wetherford, and as he put
it down beside the tent door he heard the wild pleading
of the Basque, who was struggling with his nurse&mdash;doubtless
in the belief that he was being kept a prisoner.
Only a few words like &#8220;go home&#8221; and &#8220;sheep&#8221; were
intelligible to either the nurse or the ranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep quiet now&mdash;quiet, boy! It&#8217;s all right. I&#8217;m here
to take care of you,&#8221; Wetherford repeated, endlessly.</p>
<p>Cavanagh waited till a silence came; then called, softly:
&#8220;Here&#8217;s your breakfast, Wetherford.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Move away,&#8221; retorted the man within. &#8220;Keep
your distance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross walked away a little space and Wetherford came
to the door. &#8220;The dago is sure sick, there&#8217;s no two
ways about that. How far is it to the nearest doctor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could reach one by &#8217;phone from the Kettle Ranch,
about twenty miles below here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he don&#8217;t get better to-day I reckon we&#8217;ll have to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
have a doctor.&#8221; He looked so white and old that
Cavanagh said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You need rest. Now I <i>think</i> I&#8217;ve had the smallpox&mdash;I
know I&#8217;ve been vaccinated, and if you go to bed&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re saying all that preliminary to offering to
come in here, you&#8217;re wasting your breath. I don&#8217;t
intend to let you come any nearer than you are. There
is work for you to do. Besides, there&#8217;s my girl; you&#8217;re
detailed to look after her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would a doctor come?&#8221; asked Ross, huskily, moved
by Wetherford&#8217;s words. &#8220;It&#8217;s a hard climb. Would
they think the dago worth it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wetherford&#8217;s face darkened with a look of doubt.
&#8220;It <i>is</i> a hard trip for a city man, but maybe he would
come for you&mdash;for the Government.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I doubt it, even if I were to offer my next month&#8217;s
salary as a fee. These hills are very remote to the
townsfolk, and one dago more or less of no importance,
but I&#8217;ll see what I can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross was really more concerned for Wetherford himself
than for the Basque. &#8220;If the fever is something malignant,
we must have medical aid,&#8221; he said, and went
slowly back to his own camp to ponder his puzzling
problem.</p>
<p>One thing could certainly be done, and that was to
inform Gregg and Murphy of their herder&#8217;s illness;
surely they would come to the rescue of the collie and his
flock. To reach a telephone involved either a ride over
into Deer Creek or a return to the Fork. He was
tempted to ride all the way to the Fork, for to do so would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
permit another meeting with Lee; but to do this would
require many hours longer, and half a day&#8217;s delay might
prove fatal to the Basque, and, besides, each hour of
loneliness and toil rendered Wetherford just so much
more open to the deadly attack of the disease.</p>
<p>Here was the tragic side of the wilderness. At such
moments even the Fork seemed a haven. The mountains
offer a splendid camping-place for the young and
the vigorous, but they are implacable foes to the disabled
man or the aged. They do not give loathsome
diseases like pox, but they do not aid in defence of the
sick. Coldly aloof, its clouds sail by. The night
winds bite. Its rains fall remorselessly. Sheltering
rocks there are, to be sure, but their comfort is small to
the man smitten with the scourge of the crowded city.
In such heights man is of no more value than the wolf
or the cony.</p>
<p>It was hard to leave an old and broken man in such
a drear and wind-contested spot, and yet it had to be
done. So fastening his tent securely behind a clump of
junipers, Cavanagh mounted his horse and rode away
across the boundary of the forest into the Deer Creek
Basin, which had been the bone of much contention
for nearly four years.</p>
<p>It was a high, park-like expanse, sparsely wooded,
beautiful in summer, but cold and bleak in winter.
The summers were short, and frost fell almost every week
even in July and August. It had once been a part of the
forest, but under pressure the President had permitted it
to be restored to the public lands open for entry. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
not &#8220;agricultural grounds,&#8221; as certain ranchers claimed,
but it was excellent summer pasture, and the sheepmen
and cattle-men had leaped at once into warfare to possess
it. Sheep were beaten to death with clubs by hundreds,
herders were hustled out of the park with ropes
about their necks and their outfits destroyed&mdash;and all
this within a few miles of the forest boundary, where one
small sentinel kept effective watch and ward.</p>
<p>Cavanagh had never been over this trail but once,
and he was trying to locate the cliff from which a flock
of sheep had been hurled by cattle-men some years before,
when he perceived a thin column of smoke rising
from a rocky hillside. With habitual watchfulness as to
fire, he raised his glass to his eyes and studied the spot.
It was evidently a camp-fire and smouldering dangerously,
and turning his horse&#8217;s head he rode toward it to
stamp it out. It was not upon his patrol; but that did
not matter, his duty was clear.</p>
<p>As he drew near he began to perceive signs of a broken
camp; the ground was littered with utensils. It was
not an ordinary camp-fire, and the ranger&#8217;s heart quickened.
&#8220;Another sheep-herder has been driven out, and
his tent and provisions burned!&#8221; he exclaimed, wrathfully.</p>
<p>His horse snorted and shied as he rode nearer, and
then a shudder passed through the ranger&#8217;s heart as
he perceived in the edge of the smouldering embers
a boot heel, and then&mdash;<i>a charred hand!</i> In the smoke
of that fire was the reek of human flesh.</p>
<p>For a long time the ranger sat on his horse, peering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
down into those ashes until at last it became evident to
his eyes that at least two sheep-herders had been sacrificed
on the cattle-man&#8217;s altar of hate and greed.</p>
<p>All about on the sod the story was written, all too
plain. Two men, possibly three, had been murdered&mdash;cut
to pieces and burned&mdash;not many hours before. There
stood the bloody spade with which the bodies had been
dismembered, and there lay an empty can whose oil
had been poured upon the mingled camp utensils, tent,
and wagon of the herders, in the attempt to incinerate
the hacked and dismembered limbs of the victims. The
lawlessness of the range had culminated. The ferocity
of the herder had gone beyond the savage. Here in the
sweet autumn air the reek of the cattle-man&#8217;s vengeance
rose like some hideous vapor, poisonous and obscene.</p>
<p>The ranger sickened as the bloody tale unfolded itself
before him. Then a fierce hate of such warfare flamed
in his heart. Could this enormity be committed under
any other civilized flag? Would any other Government
intermingle so foolishly, so childishly its State and
Federal authority as to permit such diabolism?</p>
<p>Here lay the legitimate fruit of the State&#8217;s essential
hoodlumism. Here was the answer to local self-government&mdash;to
democracy. Such a thing could not happen
in Australia or Canada; only in America could lynch
law become a dramatic pastime, a jest, an instrument of
private vengeance. The South and the West were alike
stained with the blood of the lynched, and the whole
nation was covered with shame.</p>
<p>In his horror, his sense of revolt, he cursed the State of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
which he was a citizen. He would have resigned his
commission at the moment, so intense was his resentment
of the supine, careless, jovial, slattern Government
under which he was serving.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the Lord!&#8221; he breathed, with solemn intensity, &#8220;if
this does not shame the people of this State into revolt,
if these fiends are not hounded and hung, I will myself
harry them. I cannot live and do my duty here unless
this crime is avenged by law.&#8221;</p>
<p>It did not matter to him that these herders were poor
Basques; it was the utter, horrifying, destructive disregard
of law which raised such tumult in his blood.
His English education, his soldier&#8217;s training, his native
refinement&mdash;all were outraged. Then, too, he loved the
West. He had surrendered his citizenship under the
British flag&mdash;for this!</p>
<p>Chilled, shaking, and numb, he set spurs to his horse
and rode furiously down the trail toward the nearest
town, so eager to spread the alarm that he could scarcely
breathe a deep breath. On the steep slopes he was
forced to walk, and his horse led so badly, that his
agony of impatience was deepened. He had a vision
of the murderers riding fast into far countries. Each
hour made their apprehension progressively the more
difficult.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who were they?&#8221; he asked himself, again and again.
&#8220;What kind of man did this thing? Was the leader
a man like Ballard? Even so, he was hired. By whom?
By ranchers covetous of the range; that was absolutely
certain.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>It was long after noon before he came to the end of
the telephone-line in a little store and post-office at the
upper falls of Deer Creek. The telephone had a booth
fortunately, and he soon had Redfield&#8217;s ear, but his
voice was so strained and unnatural that his chief did
not recognize it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that you, Ross? What&#8217;s the matter? Your
voice sounds hoarse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross composed himself, and told his story briefly. &#8220;I&#8217;m
at Kettle Ranch post-office. Now listen. The limit of
the cattle-man&#8217;s ferocity has been reached. As I rode
down here, to get into communication with a doctor for
a sick herder, I came upon the scene of another murder
and burning. The fire is still smouldering; at least
two bodies are in the embers.&#8221;</p>
<p>At last, bit by bit, from hurried speech, the supervisor
derived the fact, the location, the hour, and directed the
herder to ride back and guard the remains till the sheriff
arrived.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep it all quiet,&#8221; warned Ross, &#8220;and get the sheriff
and a doctor to come up here as quick as you can. What
in the name of God is this country coming to?&#8221; he
cried, in despair. &#8220;Will this deed go unpunished, like
the rest?&#8221;</p>
<p>Redfield&#8217;s voice had lost its optimistic ring. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know; I am stunned by it all. Don&#8217;t do anything
rash, Ross. Wait till I come. Perhaps this is the turning-point
out here. I&#8217;ll be up at the earliest moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>The embittered and disheartened ranger then called
up Lee Virginia, and the sound of her sweet voice turned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
his thoughts to other and, in a sense, more important
matters; for when she heard his name she cried out
with such eager longing and appeal that his heart
leaped. &#8220;Oh, I wish you were here! Mother has been
worse to-day. She is asking for you. Can&#8217;t you come
down and see us? She wants to tell you something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t&mdash;I can&#8217;t!&#8221; he stammered. &#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&#8217;m a
long way off, and I have important work to do. Tell
her I will come to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her voice was filled with disappointment and fear as
she said: &#8220;Oh, I need you so! Can&#8217;t you come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I will come as soon as I can. I will try to
reach you by daylight to-morrow. My heart is with
you. Call up the Redfields; they will help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother wants <i>you</i>. She says she <i>must</i> see you.
Come as soon as you can. I don&#8217;t know what she wants
to tell you&mdash;but I do know we need you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her meaning was as clear as if she said: &#8220;I need you,
for I love you. Come to me.&#8221; And her prayer filled
him with pain as well as pleasure. He was a soldier and
under orders from his chief, therefore he said: &#8220;Dear
girl, there is a sick man far up on the mountain-side
with no one to care for him but a poor old herder who
is in danger of falling sick himself. I must go back
to them; but, believe me, I will come just as soon
as my duties will let me. You understand me, don&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her voice was fainter as she said: &#8220;Yes, but I&mdash;it
seems hard to wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know. Your voice has helped me. I was in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
black mood when I came here. I&#8217;m going back now to
do my work, and then I will come to you. Good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>Strangely beautiful and very subtle was the vibrant
stir of that wire as it conveyed back to his ear the little
sigh with which she made answer to his plea. He took
his way upward in a mood which was meditative but
no longer bitter.</p>

<h2>XI</h2>
<h3>SHADOWS ON THE MIST</h3>
</div>

<p>The decision which Cavanagh made between love and
duty distinguished the officer from the man, the soldier
from the civilian. He did not hesitate to act, and yet
he suffered a mental conflict as he rode back toward the
scene of that inhuman sacrifice on the altar of greed.
His heart went out to Lee Virginia in longing. Her
appealing voice still lay in his ear with an effect like the
touch of her soft lips, and his flagging horse suffered
from the unconscious pressure of his haste.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be hours before any part of the sheriff&#8217;s posse
can reach the falls, even though they take to the swiftest
motors, and then other long hours must intervene before
I can ride down to her. Yes, at least a day and a night
must drag their slow course before I can hope to be of
service to her,&#8221; and the thought drew a groan of anxiety
from him. At such moments of mental stress the
trail is a torture and the mountain-side an inexorable
barrier.</p>
<p>Half-way to the hills he was intercepted by an old man
who was at work on an irrigating ditch beside the road.
He seemed very nervous and very inquisitive, and as he
questioned the ranger his eyes were like those of a dog
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
that fears his master&#8217;s hand. Ross wondered about this
afterward, but at the moment his mind was busy with
the significance of this patient toiler with a spade. He
was a prophetic figure in the most picturesque and sterile
land of the stockman. &#8220;Here within twenty miles of
this peaceful fruit-grower,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is the crowning
infamy of the free-booting cowboy. My God, what a
nation we are!&#8221;</p>
<p>He wondered, as he rode on, whether the papers of the
State would make a jest of <i>this</i> deed. &#8220;Will this be
made the theme for caustic comment in the Eastern press
for a day, and then be forgotten?&#8221;</p>
<p>As his hot blood cooled he lost faith in even this sacrifice.
Could anything change the leopard West into the
tameness and serenity of the ox? &#8220;No,&#8221; he decided,
&#8220;nothing but death will do that. This generation, these
fierce and bloody hearts, must die; only in that way can
the tradition of violence be overcome and a new State
reared.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the foot of the toilsome, upward-winding trail he
dismounted, and led his weary horse. Over his head,
and about half-way to the first hilltop, lay a roof of
fleecy vapor, faint purple in color and seamless in texture.
Through this he must pass, and it symbolized to
him the line of demarkation between the plain and the
mountain, between order and violence.</p>
<p>Again he rose above it, to find it a fantastic sea lit
by the sun, and glowing with pink and gold and violet.
Celestial in its ethereal beauty, it threw into still more
appalling shadow the smoking altar of passion toward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
which he spurred. From moment to moment the surface
rose and shifted in swift, tumultuous, yet soundless
waves, breaking round pine-clad promontories in shimmering
breakers, faint, and far, and serene.</p>
<p>Down through a deep canon to the south a prodigious
river of mist was rushing, a silent cataract of ashy vapor
plunging to a soundless beach. Above and beyond it
the high peaks shone in radiance so pure that the heart
of the lover ached with the pain of its evanescent beauty.
It was as if he were looking across a foaming flood upon
the stupendous and shining park of some imperial potentate
whose ornate and splendid country home lay
just beyond. Rocky spires rose like cathedral towers,
and fortresses abutted upon the stream. And yet in
the midst of that glorified plain the smoke of the burning
rose.</p>
<p>Slowly he led his horse along the mountain-side, grasping
with eager desire at every changing aspect of this
marvellous scene. It was infinitely more gorgeous, more
compelling, than his moonlight experience the night before,
for here reality, definite and powerful, was interfused
with mystery. These foot-hills, hitherto pleasantly
precipitous, had suddenly become grandiose. All was
made over upon a mightier scale, each rock and tree being
distorted by the passing translucent clouds into a kind
of monstrous yet epic proportion.</p>
<p>Ghostly white ledges broke from the darker mist like
fields of distant crusted snow. Castellated crags loomed
from the mystic river like fortified islands. Cattle, silent,
enormously aggrandized, emerged like fabled beasts of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
the eld, and stared upon him, their jaws dripping with
dew. Bulls roared from the obscure deeps. Dead trees,
with stark and sinister arms, menaced warningly. All
was as unreal as the world of pain&#8217;s delirium, and yet
was as beautiful as the poet&#8217;s vision; and the ranger,
feeling that he was looking upon one of Nature&#8217;s rarest
displays, removed his hat in worship of it, thrilling with
pride and satisfaction over the thought that this was
his domain, his to guard and preserve.</p>
<p>The crowning glow of mystery and grace came as he
led his horse out upon a projecting point of rocky ledge
to rest. Here the cliff descended abruptly to an enormous
depth, and upon the vaporous rolling flood beneath
him a dome of darker shadow rested. At the summit
of this shadow an aureole of rainbow light, a complete
and glorious circle rested, in the midst of which his own
image was flung, grotesque and gigantic.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Shadows of the Brocken!&#8221; he exclaimed, in
ecstasy, all his bitterness, his care, forgotten. &#8220;Now I
understand Goethe&#8217;s lines.&#8221; In all his life in the hills
he had never before witnessed such a combination of
peak and sun and cloud and shadow.</p>
<p>His love for the range came back upon him with such
power that tears misted his eyes and his throat ached.
&#8220;Where else will I find such scenes as this?&#8221; he asked
himself. &#8220;Where in all the lowlands could such splendors
shine? How can I leave this high world in which
these wonders come and go? I will not! Here will I
bring my bride and build my home. This is my world.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the mist grew gray, the aureole of fire faded, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
sun went down behind the hills, and the chill of evening
deepened on the trail, and as he reapproached the scene
of man&#8217;s inhumanity to man the thought of camping
there beside those charred limbs called for heroic resolution.
He was hungry, too, and as the air pinched, he
shivered.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the best, the sheriff cannot reach here before midnight,&#8221;
he said, and settled down to his unsought, revolting
vigil.</p>
<p>His one relief lay in the mental composition of a long
letter to Lee Virginia, whose life at that moment was a
comfort to him. &#8220;If such purity, such sweetness, can
come from violence and vulgarity, then surely a new and
splendid State can rise even out of the ashes of these
murdered men. Perhaps this is the end of the old,&#8221; he
mused, &#8220;perhaps this is the beginning of the new,&#8221; and
as he pondered the last faint crimson died out of the west.
&#8220;So must the hate and violence die out of America,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;leaving the clear, sweet air of liberty behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was near to the poet at the moment, for he was also
the lover. His allegiance to the great republic stood the
test. His faith in democracy was shaken, but not destroyed.
&#8220;I will wait,&#8221; he decided. &#8220;This shall be the sign.
If this deed goes unavenged, then will I put off my badge
and my uniform, and go back to the land where for a
hundred years at least such deeds as these have been
impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>He built a fire, as night fell, to serve both as beacon
and as a defence against the cold. He felt himself weirdly
remote in this vigil. From his far height he looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
abroad upon the tumbled plain as if upon an ocean dimly
perceptible yet august. &#8220;At this moment,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;curious and perhaps guilty eyes are wondering what
my spark of firelight may mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>His mind went again and again to that tall old man in
the ditch. What was the meaning of his scared and
sorrowful glance? Why should one so peacefully employed
at such a time and in such a place wear the look
of a hunted deer? What meant the tremor in his voice?</p>
<p>Was it possible that one so gentle should have taken
part in this deed? &#8220;Preposterous suspicion, and yet
he had a guilty look.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was not a believer in ghosts, but he came nearer to
a fear of the dark that night than ever before in his life.
He brought his horse close to the fire for company, and
was careful not to turn his back upon the dead. A
corpse lying peacefully would not have produced this
overpowering horror. He had seen battle-fields, but
this pile of mangled limbs conquered even the hardened
campaigner. He shivered each time his memory went
back to what he had first looked upon&mdash;the charred hand,
the helpless heel.</p>
<p>From his high hill of meditation he reviewed the history
of the West. Based in bloody wars between the primitive
races, and between the trappers and their allies, the land
had passed through a thin adumbration of civilization as
the stockmen drove out the buffalo and their hunters.
Vigilantes, sheriff&#8217;s posses (and now and again the regular
army) had swept over these grassy swells on errands
of retributory violence, and so the territory had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
divided at last into populous States. Then politics, the
great national game, had made of them a power, with
Senators to represent a mere handful of miners and herdsmen.
In the Congress of the United States these commonwealths
had played their unscrupulous games,
trading for this and for that local appropriation. Happily
in some instances these Senators had been higher than
their State, but in other cases they represented only too
loyally the violent and conscienceless cow-man or lumber
king, and now, as Redfield had said, the land-boomer
was to have his term. The man who valued residents,
not Wild West performers, was about to govern and
despoil; this promoter, almost as selfish as the cattle
king, was about to advance the State along the lines of
<i>his</i> conception of civilization; and so, perhaps, this monstrous
deed, this final inexcusable inhuman offence against
law and humanity, was to stand as a monument dividing
the old from the new. Such, at least, was the ranger&#8217;s hope.</p>
<p>At last, far in the night, he heard the snort of a horse
and the sound of voices. The law (such as it was) was
creeping up the mountain-side in the person of the sheriff
of Chauvenet County, and was about to relieve the ranger
from his painful responsibility as guardian of the dead.</p>
<p>At last he came, this officer of the law, attended (like
a Cheyenne chief) by a dozen lesser warriors of various
conditions and kinds, but among them&mdash;indeed, second
only to the sheriff&mdash;was Hugh Redfield, the Forest
Supervisor, hot and eager with haste.</p>
<p>As they rode up to the fire, the officer called out:
&#8220;Howdy, ranger! How about it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>Ross stated briefly, succinctly, what he had discovered;
and as he talked other riders came up the hill and gathered
closely around to listen in wordless silence&mdash;in
guilty silence, the ranger could not help believing.</p>
<p>The sheriff, himself a cattle-man, heard Cavanagh
without comment till he had ended with a gesture.
&#8220;And there they are; I turn them over to you with vast
relief. I am anxious to go back to my own peaceful
world, where such things do not happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheriff removed his hat and wiped his brow, then
swore with a mutter of awe. &#8220;Well, by God, this is the
limit! You say there were three bodies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I lacked the courage to sort them out. I&#8217;ve been
in battle, Mr. Sheriff, and I&#8217;ve seen dead men tumbled
in all shapes, but someway this took the stiffening
out of my knees. I rode away and left them. I don&#8217;t
care to see them again. My part of this work is
done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Redfield spoke. &#8220;Sheriff Van Horne, you and I have
been running cattle in this country for nearly thirty
years, and we&#8217;ve witnessed all kinds of shooting and
several kinds of hanging, but when it comes to chopping
and burning men, I get off. I shall personally offer a
reward of a thousand dollars for the apprehension of
these miscreants, and I hope you&#8217;ll make it your solemn
duty to hunt them to earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t have far to go,&#8221; remarked Ross, significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked the sheriff.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean this slaughter, like the others that have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
taken place, was the work of cattle-men who claim this
range. Their names are known to us all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can it be possible!&#8221; exclaimed Redfield, looking
round at the silent throng, and in the wavering light certain
eyes seemed to shift and fall.</p>
<p>&#8220;In what essential does it differ from the affair over
on the Red Desert?&#8221; demanded Cavanagh. &#8220;Who
would kill these poor sheep-herders but cattle-men
warring for the grass on which we stand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they would not dare to do such work themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one else would do it. Hired assassins would not
chop and burn. Hate and greed were both involved in
this butchery&mdash;hate and greed made mad by drink. I
tell you, the men who did this are less than a day&#8217;s ride
of where we stand.&#8221;</p>
<p>A silence followed&mdash;so deep a silence that the ranger
was convinced of the fact that in the circle of his listeners
stood those who, if they had not shared in the slaughter,
at least knew the names of the guilty men.</p>
<p>At last the sheriff spoke, this time with a sigh. &#8220;I
hope you&#8217;re all wrong, Cavanagh. I&#8217;d hate to think any
constituent of mine had sanctioned this job. Give me
that lantern, Curtis.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group of ranchers dismounted, and followed the
sheriff over to the grewsome spot; but Redfield stayed
with the ranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any suspicion, Ross?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, hardly a suspicion. However, you know as
well as I that this was not a sudden outbreak. This
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
deed was planned. It represents the feeling of many
cattle-men&mdash;in everything but the extra horror of its
execution. <i>That</i> was the work of drunken, infuriated
men. But I am more deeply concerned over Miss
Wetherford&#8217;s distress. Did she reach you by telephone
to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. What&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her mother is down again. I telephoned her, and
she asked me to come to her, but I cannot go, for I have a
case of smallpox up on the hill. Ambro, the Basque
herder, is down with it, and another herder is up there
alone with him. I must go back to them. But meanwhile
I wish you would go to the Fork and see what you
can do for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice, filled with emotion, touched Redfield, and
he said: &#8220;Can&#8217;t I go to the relief of the herder?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you must not think of it; you are a man of a
family. But if you can find any one who has had the
smallpox send him up; the old herder who is nursing the
patient is not strong, and may drop any moment. Then
it&#8217;s up to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men came back to the camp-fire conversing in low
voices, some of them cursing in tones of awe. One or two
of them were small farmers from Deer Creek, recent
comers to the State, or men with bunches of milk-cows,
and to them this deed was awesome.</p>
<p>The sheriff followed, saying: &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s nothing to
do but wait till morning. The rest of you men better
go home. You can&#8217;t be of any use here.&#8221;</p>
<p>For more than three hours the sheriff and Redfield sat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
with the ranger waiting for daylight, and during this time
the name of every man in the region was brought up and
discussed. Among others, Ross mentioned the old man
in the ditch.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t hurt a bumblebee!&#8221; declared the sheriff.
&#8220;He&#8217;s got a bunch of cattle, but he&#8217;s the mildest old man
in the State. He&#8217;s the last rancher in the country to
even stand for such work. What made you mention
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I passed him as I was riding back,&#8221; replied Cavanagh,
&#8220;and he had a scared look in his eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheriff grunted. &#8220;You imagined all that. The
old chap always has a kind of meek look.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh, tired, hungry, and rebellious, waited until
the first faint light in the east announced the dawn; then
he rose, and, stretching his hand out toward it, said:
&#8220;Here comes the new day. Will it be a new day to the
State, or is it to be the same old round of savagery?&#8221;</p>
<p>Redfield expressed a word of hope, and in that spirit
the ranger mounted and rode away back toward the small
teepee wherein Wetherford was doing his best to expiate
his past&mdash;a past that left him old and friendless at fifty-five.
The sheriff and his men took up the work of vengeance
which fell to them as officers of the law.</p>
<p>It was nearly noon of a glorious day as Cavanagh, very
tired and very hungry, rode up to the sheep-herder&#8217;s tent.
Wetherford was sitting in the sun calmly smoking his
pipe, the sheep were feeding not far away, attended by the
dog, and an air of peace covered his sunlit rocky world.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is the Basque?&#8221; asked the ranger.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>Wetherford pointed upward. &#8220;All over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it wasn&#8217;t smallpox?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that&#8217;s what it was; it sure was fierce. I
judge it&#8217;s a case of Injun burial&mdash;no ceremony&mdash;right here
in the rocks. I&#8217;ll let you dig the hole (I&#8217;m just about
all in), but mind you keep to the windward all the time.
I don&#8217;t want you spotted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh understood the necessity for these precautions,
but first of all came his own need of food and rest.
Turning his tired horse to grass, he stretched himself
along a grassy, sunny cranny between the rocks, and
there ate and afterward slept, while all about him the
lambs called and the conies whined.</p>
<p>He was awakened by a pebble tossed upon him, and
when he arose, stiff and sore, but feeling stronger and
in better temper, the sun was wearing low. Setting to
work at his task, he threw the loose rock out of a hollow
in the ledge near by, and to this rude sepulchre Wetherford
dragged the dead man, refusing all aid, and there
piled a cairn of rocks above his grave.</p>
<p>The ranger was deeply moved by the pitiless contrast
of the scene and the drama. The sun was still shining
warmly aslant the heavens; the wind, crisp and sweet,
wandered by on laggard wings, the conies cried from
the ledges; the lambs were calling&mdash;and in the midst
of it one tattered fragment of humanity was heaping
the iron earth upon another, stricken, perhaps, by the
same dread disease.</p>
<p>Wetherford himself paused to moralize. &#8220;I suppose
that chap has a mother somewhere who is wondering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
where her boy is. This isn&#8217;t exactly Christian burial,
but it&#8217;s all he&#8217;ll get, I reckon; for whether it was smallpox
or plain fever, nobody&#8217;s going to uselessly resurrect
him. Even the coyotes will fight shy of his meat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the ranger took a hand at the end and
rolled some huge bowlders upon the grave, to insure the
wolves&#8217; defeat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now burn the bedding,&#8221; he commanded&mdash;&#8220;the whole
camp has got to go&mdash;and your clothing, too, after we
get down the hill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What will we do with the sheep?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Drive them over the divide and leave them.&#8221;</p>
<p>All these things Wetherford did, and leaving the camp
in ashes behind him, Cavanagh drove the sheep before
him on his homeward way. As night fell, the dog, at his
command, rounded them up and put them to bed, and
the men went on down the valley, leaving the brave brute
on guard, pathetic figure of faithful guardianship.</p>
<p>&#8220;It hurts me to desert you, old fellow,&#8221; called the
ranger, looking back, &#8220;but there&#8217;s no help for it. I&#8217;ll
come up in the morning and bring you some biscuit.&#8221;</p>
<p>The collie seemed to understand. He waggled his
tail and whined, as though struggling to express his wonder
and pain, and Ross, moved to pity, called: &#8220;Come on,
boy, never mind the sheep! Come along with us!&#8221;</p>
<p>But the dog, leaping from side to side, uttered a short
howl and a sharp bark, as if to say: &#8220;I can&#8217;t! I can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s onto <i>his</i> job,&#8221; remarked Wetherford. &#8220;It beats
all how human they do seem sometimes. I&#8217;ve no manner
of doubt that dago&#8217;s booted him all over the place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
many a time, and yet he seemed horrible sorry about his
master&#8217;s trouble. Every few minutes, all night long, he&#8217;d
come pattering and whining round the door of the tent&mdash;didn&#8217;t
come in, seemed just trying to ask how things
were coming. He was like a child, lonesome and
grieving.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was long after dark when they entered the canon
just above the cabin, and Wetherford was shivering from
cold and weakness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you pull up just outside the gate, and wait there
till I bring out some blankets; then you&#8217;ve got to strip to
the skin and start the world all over again,&#8221; said Cavanagh.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll build a fire here, and we&#8217;ll cremate your
past. How about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing,&#8221; responded Wetherford. &#8220;You can
burn everything that belongs to me but my wife and my
girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>All through the ceremony which followed ran this
self-banter. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be all ranger, barring a commission,&#8221;
he said, with a grin, as he put on the olive-yellow shirt
and a pair of dusty-green trousers. &#8220;And here goes my
past!&#8221; he added, as he tossed his contaminated rags
upon the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a corking opportunity to make a fresh start,&#8221;
commented Cavanagh. &#8220;I hope you see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see it; but it&#8217;s hard to live up to your mark.&#8221;</p>
<p>When every precaution had been taken, the ranger
led the freshly scrubbed, scoured, and transformed fugitive
to his cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, man, you&#8217;re fit for the State Legislature,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
exclaimed, as they came into the full light. &#8220;My clothes
don&#8217;t precisely meet every demand you make upon
them, but they give you an air of command. I wish
your wife could see you now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wetherford was quite serious as he answered: &#8220;This
uniform means more to me than you think. I wish I
was entitled to wear it. The wild-wood is just about
populous enough for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for you!&#8221; responded Cavanagh. &#8220;To convert
a man of your record to a belief in conservation is to
demonstrate once again the regenerative power of an
idea.&#8221; Then, seeing that Wetherford was really in
earnest, he added: &#8220;You can stay with me as long as you
wish. Perhaps in time you might be able to work into
the service as a guard, although the chief is getting more
and more insistent on real foresters.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were tears in Wetherford&#8217;s eyes as he said:
&#8220;You cannot realize what this clean, warm uniform
means to me. For nine years I wore the prison stripes;
then I was turned loose with a shoddy suit and a hat a
size too big for me&mdash;an outfit that gave me away everywhere
I went. Till my hair and beard sprouted I had
a hard rustle of it, but my clothes grew old faster than
my beard. At last I put every cent I had earned into a
poor old horse, and a faded saddle, and once mounted I
kept a-moving north.&#8221; He smoothed the sleeve of his
coat. &#8220;It is ten years since I was dressed like a
man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You need not worry about food or shelter for the
present,&#8221; replied Cavanagh, gently. &#8220;Grub is not costly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
here, and house-rent is less than nominal, so make yourself
at home and get strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wetherford lifted his head. &#8220;But I want to do something.
I want to redeem myself in some way. I don&#8217;t
want my girl to know who I am, but I&#8217;d like to win her
respect. I can&#8217;t be what you say she thinks I was, but
if I had a chance I might show myself a man again. I
wouldn&#8217;t mind Lize knowing that I am alive&mdash;it might
be a comfort to her; but I don&#8217;t want even her to be told
till I can go to her in my own duds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s pretty sick,&#8221; said Cavanagh. &#8220;I telephoned Lee
Virginia last night, and if you wish you may ride down
with me to-morrow and see her.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man fell a-tremble. &#8220;I daren&#8217;t do that. I
can&#8217;t bear to tell her where I&#8217;ve been!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She needn&#8217;t know. I will tell her you&#8217;ve been out of
your mind. I&#8217;ll say anything you wish! You can go to her
in the clothes you have on if you like&mdash;she will not recognize
you as the prisoner I held the other night. You
can have your beard trimmed, and not even the justice
will know you.&#8221;</p>
<p>All reserve had vanished out of the convict&#8217;s heart, and
with choking voice he thanked his young host. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
never be a burden to you,&#8221; he declared, in firmer voice.
&#8220;And if my lung holds out, I&#8217;ll show you I&#8217;m not the
total locoe that I &#8217;pear to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>No further reference was made to Lee Virginia, but
Ross felt himself to be more deeply involved than ever
by these promises; his fortunes seemed to be inextricably
bound up with this singular and unhappy family. Lying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
in his bunk (after the lights were out), he fancied himself
back in his ancestral home, replying to the questions of
his aunts and uncles, who were still expecting him to
bring home a rich and beautiful American heiress. Some
of the Cavanaghs were drunkards and some were vixens,
but they were on the whole rather decent, rather decorous
and very dull, and to them this broken ex-convict and
this slattern old barmaid would seem very far from the
ideal they had formed of the family into which Ross was
certain to marry.</p>
<p>But as he recalled the spot in which he lay and the
uniform which hung upon the wall, he was frank to admit
that the beautiful and rich heiress of whom his family
dreamed was a very unsubstantial vision indeed, and
that, to be honest with himself, he had nothing to offer
for such shining good-fortune.</p>
<p>At breakfast next morning he said: &#8220;I must ride back
and take some bread to the dog. I can&#8217;t go away and
leave him there without saying &#8216;hello.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me do that,&#8221; suggested Wetherford. &#8220;I&#8217;m
afraid to go down to the Fork. I reckon I&#8217;d better go
back and tend the sheep till Gregg sends some one up
to take my place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That might be too late to see Lize. Lee&#8217;s voice
showed great anxiety. She may be on her death-bed.
No; you&#8217;d better go down with me to-day,&#8221; he urged.
And at last the old man consented.</p>
<p>Putting some bread in his pockets, Ross rode off up
the trail to see how the dog and his flock were faring.
He had not gone far when he heard the tinkle of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
bells and the murmur of the lambs, and a few moments
later the collie came toward him with the air of a boy
who, having assumed to disregard the orders of his
master, expects a scolding. He plainly said: &#8220;I&#8217;ve
brought my sheep to you because I was lonesome.
Please forgive me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh called to him cheerily, and tossed him a
piece of bread, which he caught in his teeth but did not
swallow; on the contrary, he held it while leaping for
joy of the praise he heard in his new-found master&#8217;s
voice.</p>
<p>Turning the flock upward again toward the higher
peaks, the ranger commanded the collie to their heels,
and so, having redeemed his promise, rode back to the
cabin, where he found Wetherford saddled and ready
for his momentous trip to the valley. He had shaved
away his gray beard, and had Ross been unprepared for
these changes he would have been puzzled to account
for this decidedly military figure sitting statuesquely on
his pony before the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can prove an alibi,&#8221; he called, as he drew near.
&#8220;Gregg himself would never recognize you now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wetherford was in no mood for joking. &#8220;Lize will.
I wore a mustache in the old days, and there&#8217;s a scar
on my chin.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he rode he confided this strange thing to Cavanagh.
&#8220;I know,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that Lize is old and wrinkled, for
I&#8217;ve seen her, but all the same I can&#8217;t realize it. That
heavy-set woman down there is not Lize. My Lize is
slim and straight. This woman whom you know has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
stolen her name and face, that&#8217;s all. I can&#8217;t explain
exactly what I feel, but Lee Virginia means more to me
now than Lize.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I understand you,&#8221; said Cavanagh, with
sympathy in his voice.</p>
<p>The nearer Wetherford came to the actual meeting
with his wife the more he shook. At last he stopped in
the road. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I can do it,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be like a ghost to her. What&#8217;s the use of it? She&#8217;ll
only be worried by my story. I reckon I&#8217;d better keep
dark to everybody. Let me go back. I&#8217;m plum scared
cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>While still he argued, two men on horseback rounded
a sharp turn in the trail and came face to face with the
ranger. Wetherford&#8217;s face went suddenly gray. &#8220;My
God, there&#8217;s the deputy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep quiet. I&#8217;ll do the talking,&#8221; commanded Cavanagh,
who was instant in his determination to shield
the man. &#8220;Good-morning, gentlemen,&#8221; he called, cheerily,
&#8220;you&#8217;re abroad early!&#8221;</p>
<p>The man in front was the deputy sheriff of the county;
his companion was a stranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a horrible mess you stumbled on over on
Deer Creek,&#8221; the deputy remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly was. Have any arrests been made?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet, but we&#8217;re on a clew. This is Marshal
Haines, of Dallas, Mr. Cavanagh,&#8221; pursued the deputy.
The two men nodded in token of the introduction,
and the deputy went on: &#8220;You remember that old cuss
that used to work for Gregg?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>Again Cavanagh nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that chap is wanted by the Texas authorities.
Mr. Haines, here, wants to see him mighty bad. He&#8217;s an
escaped convict with a bad record.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; exclaimed Cavanagh. &#8220;I thought he
seemed a bit gun-shy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The last seen of him was when Sam Gregg sent him
up to herd sheep. I think he was mixed up in that killing,
myself&mdash;him and Ballard&mdash;and we&#8217;re going up to get
some track of him. Didn&#8217;t turn up at your station, did
he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he came by some days ago, on his way, so he
said, to relieve that sick Basque, Ambro. I went up a
couple of days ago, and found the Basque dead and the
old man gone. I buried the herder the best I could, and
I&#8217;m on my way down to report the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deputy mused: &#8220;He may be hanging &#8217;round some
of the lumber-camps. I reckon we had better go up and
look the ground over, anyhow. We might just chance to
overhaul him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He may have pulled out over the range,&#8221; suggested
the ranger. &#8220;Anyhow, it&#8217;s a long way up there, and
you&#8217;ll probably have to camp at my place to-night.
You&#8217;ll find the key hanging up over the door. Go in
and make yourself comfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deputy thanked him, and was about to ride on
when Cavanagh added: &#8220;I burned that Basque&#8217;s tent
and bedding for fear of contagion. His outfit was worthless,
anyhow. You&#8217;ll find the sheep just above my
cabin, and the horse in my corral.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The old man didn&#8217;t take the horse, eh? Well, that
settles it; he&#8217;s sure at one of the camps. Much obliged.
Good-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the two officers rode away Wetherford leaned heavily
on his pommel and stared at the ranger with wide eyes.
His face was drawn and his lips dry. &#8220;They&#8217;ll get me!
My God, they&#8217;ll get me!&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no, they won&#8217;t,&#8221; rejoined Cavanagh. &#8220;You&#8217;re
all right yet. They suspected nothing. How could
they, with you in uniform and in my company?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the same, I&#8217;m scared. That man Haines had his
eyes on me every minute. He saw right through me.
They&#8217;ll get me, and they&#8217;ll charge me up with that
killing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they won&#8217;t, I tell you,&#8221; insisted the ranger.
&#8220;Haines suspected nothing. I had his eye. He never
saw you before, and has nothing but a description to go
by. So cheer up. Your uniform and your position with
me will make you safe&mdash;perfectly safe. They&#8217;ll find the
Basque&#8217;s camp burned and the sheep in charge of the
dog, and they&#8217;ll fancy that you have skipped across the
range. But see here, old man,&#8221; and he turned on him
sharply, &#8220;you didn&#8217;t tell me the whole truth. You said
you were out on parole.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t tell you the whole truth,&#8221; replied the
fugitive. &#8220;But I will now. I was in for a life sentence.
I was desperate for the open air and homesick for the
mountains, and I struck down one of the guards. I was
willing to do anything to get out. I thought if I could
get back to this country and my wife and child I&#8217;d be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
safe. I said I&#8217;d be willing to go back to the pen if
necessary, but I&#8217;m not. I can&#8217;t do it. I&#8217;d die there in
that hell. You must save me for my girl&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice and eyes were wild with a kind of desperate
fury of fear, and Cavanagh, moved to pity, assured him of
his aid. &#8220;Now listen,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to shield
you on account of your work for that poor shepherd and
for your daughter&#8217;s sake. It&#8217;s my duty to apprehend you,
of course, but I&#8217;m going to protect you. The safest thing
for you to do is to go back to my cabin. Ride slow, so
as not to get there till they&#8217;re gone. They&#8217;ll ride over
to the sawmill, without doubt. If they come back this
way, remember that the deputy saw you only as a ragged
old man with a long beard, and that Haines has nothing
but a printed description to go by. There&#8217;s no use trying
to flee. You are a marked man in that uniform, and you
are safer right here with me than anywhere else this side
of Chicago. Haines is likely to cross the divide in the
belief that you have gone that way, and, if he does, you
have no one but the deputy to deal with.&#8221;</p>
<p>He succeeded at last in completely rousing the older
man&#8217;s courage.</p>
<p>Wetherford rose to meet his opportunity. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221;
he said, firmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the talk!&#8221; exclaimed Cavanagh, to encourage
him. &#8220;You can throw them off the track this time, and
when I come back to-morrow I&#8217;ll bring some other
clothing for you, and then we&#8217;ll plan some kind of a
scheme that will get you out of the country. I&#8217;ll not let
them make a scapegoat of you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>The ranger watched the fugitive, as he started back
over the trail in this desperate defiance of his pursuers,
with far less confidence in the outcome than he
had put into words.</p>
<p>&#8220;All depends on Wetherford himself. If his nerve
does not fail him, if they take the uniform for granted,
and do not carry the matter to the Supervisor, we will
pull the plan through.&#8221; And in this hope he rode
away down the trail with bent head, for all this bore
heavily upon his relationship to the girl waiting for him
in the valley. He had thought Lize a burden, a social
disability, but a convict father now made the mother&#8217;s
faults of small account.</p>
<p>The nearer he drew to the meeting with Lee Virginia
the more important that meeting became. After all,
woman is more important than war. The love of home
and the child persists through incredible vicissitudes;
the conqueror returns from foreign lands the lover still;
and in the deep of flooded mines and on the icy slopes of
arctic promontories dead men have been found holding
in their rigid hands the pictured face of some fair girl.
In the presence of such irrefutable testimony, who shall
deny the persistence and the reality of love?</p>
<p>Cavanagh had seen Virginia hardly more than a score
of times, and yet she filled his thought, confused his plans,
making of his brain a place of doubt and hesitation. For
her sake he had entered upon a plan to shield a criminal,
to harbor an escaped convict. It was of no avail to argue
that he was moved to shield Wetherford because of his
heroic action on the peak. He knew perfectly well that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
it was because he could not see that fair, brave girl
further disgraced by the discovery of her father&#8217;s identity,
for in the searching inquiry which would surely follow
his secret would develop.</p>
<p>To marry her, knowing the character of her father and
her mother, was madness, and the voice within him warned
him of his folly. &#8220;Pure water cannot be drawn from
corrupt sources,&#8221; it is said. Nevertheless, the thought of
having the girl with him in the wilderness filled him with
divine recklessness. He was bewitched by the satin
smoothness of her skin, the liquid light of her eye, the
curve of her cheek, the swell of her bosom, and, most of
all, by the involuntary movement of yielding which betrayed
her trust and her love. While still he debated,
alternately flushed with resolve to be happy and chilled
by some strange dejection, he met Swenson, the young
guard who guarded the forest on the south Fork.</p>
<p>As he rode up, Cavanagh perceived in the other man&#8217;s
face something profoundly serious. He did not smile in
greeting, as was usual with him, and, taking some letters
from his pocket, passed them over in ominous silence.</p>
<p>Cavanagh, upon looking them over, selected a letter
evidently from Mrs. Redfield, and stuffed the others
into his coat-pocket. It was a closely written letter, and
contained in its first sentence something which deeply
affected him. Slipping from his saddle, he took a seat
upon a stone, that he might the better read and slowly
digest what was contained therein. He read on slowly,
without any other movement than that which was required
to turn the leaves. It was a passionate plea from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
Eleanor Redfield against his further entanglement with
Lize Wetherford&#8217;s girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;You cannot afford to marry her. You simply cannot.
The old mother is too dreadful, and may live on for years.
The girl is attractive, I grant you, but she&#8217;s tainted. If
there is anything in the law of heredity, she will develop
the traits of her mother or her father sooner or later.
You must not marry her, Ross; and if you cannot, what
will you do? There&#8217;s only one thing to do. Keep away.
I enclose a letter from your sister, pleading with me to
urge you to visit them this winter. She is not very
strong, as you can see by her writing, and her request
will give you an excuse for breaking off all connection
with this girl. I am sorry for her, Ross, but you can&#8217;t
marry her. You must not&mdash;you must not! Ride over
and see us soon, and we will talk it all out together.&#8221;</p>
<p>He opened another letter, but did not read it. He was
too profoundly shaken by the first. He felt the pure
friendship, the fine faith, and the guardianship of the
writer, and he acknowledged the good sense of all she
said, and yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;</p>
<p>When he looked up Swenson was staring down at him
with a face of such bitterness that it broke through even
the absorbed and selfish meditation into which he had
been thrown.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Swenson? You look as if you
had lost a friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; answered the guard, shortly, &#8220;and so have
you. The chief is out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got him!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;He&#8217;s out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh sprang up. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it! For what
reason? Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t that letter tell you? The whole town is
chuckling. Every criminal and plug-ugly in the country
is spitting in our faces this morning. Yes, sir, the President
has fired the chief&mdash;the man that built up this
Forestry Service. The whole works is goin&#8217; to hell,
that&#8217;s what it is. We&#8217;ll have all the coal thieves,
water-power thieves, poachers, and free-grass pirates
piling in on us in mobs. They&#8217;ll eat up the forest. I
see the finish of the whole business. They&#8217;ll put some
Western man in, somebody they can work. Then where
will we be?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh&#8217;s young heart burned with indignation, but
he tried to check the other man&#8217;s torrent of protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe it. There&#8217;s some mistake. Maybe
they&#8217;ve made him the secretary of the department or
something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they haven&#8217;t. They&#8217;ve thrown him out. They&#8217;ve
downed him because he tried to head off some thievery
of coal-mines in Alaska.&#8221; The man was ready to weep
with chagrin and indignant sorrow. His voice choked,
and he turned away to conceal his emotion.</p>
<p>Cavanagh put the letter back into his pocket and
mounted his horse. &#8220;Well, go on back to your work,
Swenson. I&#8217;m going to town to get the Supervisor on
the wire, and find out what it all means.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was almost as badly stunned by the significance of
Swenson&#8217;s news as Swenson himself. Could it be possible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
that the man who had built up the field service of the
bureau&mdash;the man whose clean-handed patriotism had
held the boys together, making them every year more
clearly a unit, a little army of enthusiasts&mdash;could it be possible
that the originator, the organizer of this great plan,
had been stricken down just when his influence was of
most account? He refused to believe it of an administration
pledged to the cause of conservation.</p>
<p>As he entered the town he was struck instantly by the
change in the faces turned toward him, in the jocular
greetings hurled at him. &#8220;Hello, Mr. Cossack! What
do you think of your chief now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This will put an end to your infernal nonsense,&#8221; said
another. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have a man in there now who knows the
Western ways, and who&#8217;s willing to boom things along.
The cork is out of your forest bottle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gregg was most offensive of all. &#8220;This means throwing
open the forest to anybody that wants to use it.
Means an entire reversal of this fool policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait and see,&#8221; replied Cavanagh, but his face was
rigid with the repression of the fear and anger he felt.
With hands that trembled he opened the door to the
telephone-booth, closed it carefully behind him, and
called for the Supervisor&#8217;s office. As soon as Redfield
replied, he burst forth in question: &#8220;Is it true that the
chief is out?&#8221;</p>
<p>Redfield&#8217;s voice was husky as he replied, &#8220;Yes, lad,
they&#8217;ve got him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord! What a blow to the service!&#8221; exclaimed
Cavanagh, with a groan of sorrow and rage. &#8220;What
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
is the President thinking of&mdash;to throw out the only man
who stood for the future, the man who had built up this
corps, who was its inspiration?&#8221; Then after a pause he
added, with bitter resolution: &#8220;This ends it for me.
Here&#8217;s where I get off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that, boy. We need you now more than
ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m through. I&#8217;m done with America&mdash;with the
States. I shall write my resignation at once. Send down
another man to take my place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Redfield&#8217;s pleadings were of no avail. Cavanagh
went directly from the booth to the post-office, and there,
surrounded by jeering and exultant citizens, he penned
his resignation and mailed it. Then, with stern and contemptuous
face, he left the place, making no reply to the
jeers of his enemies, and, mounting his horse, mechanically
rode away out upon the plains, seeking the quiet,
open places in order to regain calmness and decision. He
did not deliberately ride away from Lee Virginia, but as
he entered upon the open country he knew that he was
leaving her as he was leaving the forests. He had cut
himself off from her as he had cut himself off from the
work he loved. His heart was swollen big within his
breast. He longed for the return of &#8220;the Colonel&#8221; to
the White House. &#8220;What manner of ruler is this who
is ready to strike down the man whose very name means
conservation, and who in a few years would have made
this body of forest rangers the most effective corps of its
size in the world?&#8221; He groaned again, and his throat
ached with the fury of his indignation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Dismissed for insubordination,&#8221; the report said.
&#8220;In what way? Only in making war on greed, in
checking graft, in preserving the heritage of the people.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lash that cut deepest was the open exultation of
the very men whose persistent attempt to appropriate
public property the chief had helped to thwart. &#8220;Redfield
will go next. The influence that got the chief will
get Hugh. He&#8217;s too good a man to escape. Then, as
Swenson says, the thieves will roll in upon us to slash,
and burn, and corrupt. What a country! What a
country!&#8221;</p>
<p>As he reached the end of this line of despairing thought,
he came back to the question of his remaining personal
obligations. Wetherford must be cared for, and then&mdash;and
then! there was Virginia waiting for him at this
moment. In his weakness he confessed that he had
never intended to marry her, and yet he had never deliberately
intended to do her wrong. He had always
stopped short of the hideous treachery involved in despoiling
her young love. &#8220;And for her sake, to save
her from humiliation, I will help her father to freedom.&#8221;</p>
<p>This brought him back to the hideous tragedy of the
heights, and with that thought the last shred of faith in
the sense of justice in the State vanished.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will never discover those murderers. They
will permit this outrage to pass unpunished, like the
others. It will be merely another &#8216;dramatic incident&#8217;
in the history of the range.&#8221;</p>
<p>His pony of its own accord turned, and by a circuitous
route headed at last for the home canon as if it knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
its master&#8217;s wavering mind. Cavanagh observed what
he was doing, but his lax hand did not intervene. Helpless
to make the decision himself, he welcomed the intervention
of the homing instinct of his horse. With
bent head and brooding face he returned to the silence of
the trail and the loneliness of the hills.</p>

<h2>XII</h2>
<h3>CAVANAGH&#8217;S LAST VIGIL BEGINS</h3>
</div>

<p>On his solitary ride upward and homeward the ranger
searched his heart and found it bitter and disloyal.
Love had interfered with duty, and pride had checked
and defeated love. His path, no longer clear and definite,
looped away aimlessly, lost in vague, obscure
meanderings. His world had suddenly grown gray.</p>
<p>The magnificent plan of the Chief Forester (to which
he had pledged such buoyant allegiance) was now a
thing apart, a campaign in which he was to be merely
an onlooker. It had once offered something congenial,
helpful, inspiring; now it seemed fantastic and futile
without the man who shaped it. &#8220;I am nearing forty,&#8221;
he said; &#8220;Eleanor is right. I am wasting my time here
in these hills; but what else can I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>He had no trade, no business, no special skill, save in
the ways of the mountaineer, and to return to his ancestral
home at the moment seemed a woful confession of
failure.</p>
<p>But the cause of his deepest dismay and doubt was
the revelation to himself of the essential lawlessness of
his love, a force within him which now made his duties
as a law-enforcer sadly ironic. After all, was not the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
man who presumed upon a maiden&#8217;s passion and weakness
a greater malefactor than he who steals a pearl or
strangles a man for his gold? To betray a soul, to
poison a young life, is this not the unforgivable crime?</p>
<p>&#8220;Here am I, a son of the law, complaining of the
lawlessness of the West&mdash;fighting it, conquering it&mdash;and
yet at the same time I permit myself to descend to the
level of Neill Ballard, to think as the barbaric man
thinks.&#8221;</p>
<p>He burned hot with contempt of himself, and his teeth
set hard in the resolution to put himself beyond the
reach of temptation. &#8220;Furthermore, I am concealing a
criminal, cloaking a convict, when I should be arresting
him,&#8221; he pursued, referring back to Wetherford. &#8220;And
why? Because of a girl&#8217;s romantic notion of her father,
a notion which can be preserved only by keeping his
secret, by aiding him to escape.&#8221; And even this motive,
he was obliged to confess, had not all been on the highest
plane. It was all a part of his almost involuntary campaign
to win Virginia&#8217;s love. The impulse had been
lawless, lawless as the old-time West, and the admission
cut deep into his self-respect.</p>
<p>It was again dusk as he rode up to his own hitching-pole
and slipped from the saddle.</p>
<p>Wetherford came out, indicating by his manner that
he had recovered his confidence once more. &#8220;How did
you find things in the valley?&#8221; he inquired, as they walked
away toward the corral.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bad,&#8221; responded the ranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The chief has been dismissed and all the rascals are
chuckling with glee. I&#8217;ve resigned from the service.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wetherford was aghast. &#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not serve under any other chief. The best
thing for you to do is to go out when I do. I think by
keeping on that uniform you can get to the train with
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see Lize and my girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I only remained in town a minute. It was too
hot for me. I&#8217;m done with it. Wetherford, I&#8217;m going
back to civilization. No more wild West for me.&#8221; The
bitterness of his voice touched the older man&#8217;s heart, but
he considered it merely a mood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t lose your nerve; mebbe this ends the reign of
terror.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing will end the moral shiftlessness of this
country but the death of the freebooter. You can&#8217;t put
new wine into old bottles. These cattle-men, deep in
their hearts, sympathize with the wiping-out of those
sheep-herders. The cry for justice comes from the man
whose ear is not being chewed&mdash;the man far off&mdash;and
from the town-builder who knows the State is being hurt
by such atrocities; but the ranchers over on Deer Creek
will conceal the assassins&mdash;you know that. You&#8217;ve had
experience with these free-grass warriors; you know
what they are capable of. That job was done by men
who hated the dagoes&mdash;hated &#8217;em because they were
rival claimants for the range. It&#8217;s nonsense to attempt
to fasten it on men like Neill Ballard. The men who
did that piece of work are well-known stock-owners.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that&#8217;s so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, who&#8217;s going to convict them? I can&#8217;t do
it. I&#8217;m going to pull out as soon as I can put my books
in shape, and you&#8217;d better go too.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were standing at the gate of the corral, and the
roar of the mountain stream enveloped them in a cloud
of sound.</p>
<p>Wetherford spoke slowly: &#8220;I hate to lose my girl,
now that I&#8217;ve seen her, but I guess you&#8217;re right; and Lize,
poor old critter! It&#8217;s hell&#8217;s shame the way I&#8217;ve queered
her life, and I&#8217;d give my right arm to be where I was
twelve years ago; but with a price on my head and old
age comin&#8217; on, I don&#8217;t see myself ever again getting up
to par. It&#8217;s a losing game for me now.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was resignation as well as despair in his voice
and Cavanagh felt it, but he said, &#8220;There&#8217;s one other
question that may come up for decision&mdash;if that Basque
died of smallpox, you may possibly take it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve figured on that, but it will take a day or two to
show on me. I don&#8217;t feel any ache in my bones yet.
If I do come down, you keep away from me. You&#8217;ve
got to live and take care of Virginia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She should never have returned to this accursed
country,&#8221; Cavanagh harshly replied, starting back toward
the cabin.</p>
<p>The constable, smoking his pipe beside the fireplace,
did not present an anxious face; on the contrary, he
seemed plumply content as he replied to the ranger&#8217;s
greeting. He represented very well the type of officer
which these disorderly communities produce. Brave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
and tireless when working along the line of his prejudices,
he could be most laxly inefficient when his duties
cut across his own or his neighbor&#8217;s interests. Being
a cattle-man by training, he was glad of the red herring
which the Texas officer had trailed across the line of his
pursuit.</p>
<p>This attitude still further inflamed Cavanagh&#8217;s indignant
hate of the country. The theory which the deputy
developed was transparent folly. &#8220;It was just a case
of plain robbery,&#8221; he argued. &#8220;One of them dagoes
had money, and Neill Ballard and that man Edwards
just naturally follered him and killed the whole bunch
and scooted&mdash;that&#8217;s my guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh&#8217;s outburst was prevented by the scratching
and whining of a dog at his door. For a moment he
wondered at this; his perturbed mind had dropped the
memory of the loyal collie.</p>
<p>As he opened the door, the brute, more than half
human in his gaze, looked beseechingly at his new master,
as if to say, &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t help it&mdash;I was so lonely.
And I love you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You poor beastie,&#8221; the ranger called, pityingly, and
the dog leaped up in a frenzy of joyous relief, putting
his paws on his breast, then dropped to the ground, and,
crouching low on his front paws, quivered and yawned
with ecstasy of worship. It seemed that he could not
express his passionate adoration, his relief, except by
these grotesque contortions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, Laddie!&#8221; Ross urged, but this the dog refused
to do. &#8220;I am a creature of the open air,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
seemed to say. &#8220;My duties are of the outer world. I
have no wish for a fireside&mdash;all I need is a master&#8217;s praise
and a bit of bread.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh brought some food, and, putting it down
outside the door, spoke to him, gently: &#8220;Good boy!
Eat that and go back to your flock. I&#8217;ll come to see you
in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Cavanagh, a few minutes later, went to the door
the dog was gone, and, listening, the ranger could hear the
faint, diminishing bleating of the sheep on the hillside
above the corral. The four-footed warden was with his
flock.</p>
<p>An hour later the sound of a horse&#8217;s hoofs on the
bridge gave warning of a visitor, and as Cavanagh went
to the door Gregg rode up, seeking particulars as to
the death of the herder and the whereabouts of the
sheep.</p>
<p>The ranger was not in a mood to invite the sheepman
in, and, besides, he perceived the danger to which Wetherford
was exposed. Therefore his answers were short.
Gregg, on his part, did not appear anxious to enter.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened to that old hobo I sent up?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>Cavanagh briefly retold his story, and at the end of it
Gregg grunted. &#8220;You say you burned the tent and all
the bedding?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every thread of it. It wasn&#8217;t safe to leave it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What ailed the man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but it looked and smelled like smallpox.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>The deputy rose with a spring. &#8220;Smallpox! You
didn&#8217;t <i>handle</i> the cuss?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh did not spare him. &#8220;Somebody had to lend
a hand. I couldn&#8217;t see him die there alone, and he had
to be buried, so I did the job.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gregg recoiled a step or two, but the deputy stood
staring, the implication of all this sinking deep. &#8220;Were
you wearing the same clothes you&#8217;ve got on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but I used a slicker while working around the
body.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good King!&#8221; The sweat broke out on the man&#8217;s
face. &#8220;You ought to be arrested.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross took a step toward him. &#8220;I&#8217;m at your service.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep off!&#8221; shouted the sheriff.</p>
<p>Ross smiled, then became very serious. &#8220;I took every
precaution, Mr. Deputy; I destroyed everything that
could possibly carry the disease. I burned every utensil,
including the saddle, everything but the man&#8217;s horse and
his dog!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The dog!&#8221; exclaimed the deputy, seized with another
idea. &#8220;Not that dog you fed just now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The very same,&#8221; replied Cavanagh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know a dog&#8217;s sure to carry the poison in
his hair? Why, <i>he jumped on you</i>! Why didn&#8217;t you
shoot him?&#8221; he demanded, fiercely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he&#8217;s a faithful guardian, and, besides, he was
with the sheep, and never so much as entered the tent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you <i>know</i> that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not absolutely, but he seemed to be on shy terms with
the herder, and I&#8217;m sure&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></p>
<p>The officer caught up his hat and coat and started for
the door. &#8220;It&#8217;s me for the open air,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>As the men withdrew Ross followed them, and, standing
in his door, delivered his final volley. &#8220;If this State does
not punish those fiends, every decent man should emigrate
out of it, turning the land over to the wolves, the
wildcats, and other beasts of prey.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gregg, as he retreated, called back: &#8220;That&#8217;s all right,
Mr. Ranger, but you&#8217;d better keep to the hills for a
few weeks. The settlers down below won&#8217;t enjoy having
a man with smallpox chassayin&#8217; around town.
They might rope and tie you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wetherford came out of his hiding-place with a grave
face. &#8220;I wonder I didn&#8217;t think of that collie. They
say a cat&#8217;s fur will carry disease germs like a sponge.
Must be the same with a dog.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s too late now,&#8221; replied Cavanagh. &#8220;But
they&#8217;re right about our staying clear of town. They&#8217;ll
quarantine us sure. All the same, I don&#8217;t believe the
dog carried any germs of the disease.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wetherford, now that the danger of arrest was over,
was disposed to be grimly humorous. &#8220;There&#8217;s no great
loss without some small gain. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll be
troubled by any more visitors&mdash;not even by sheriffs or
doctors. I reckon you and I are in for a couple of
months of the quiet life&mdash;the kind we read about.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Cavanagh, now that he was definitely out of the Forest
Service, perceived the weight of every objection which
his friends and relatives had made against his going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
into it. It was a lonely life, and must ever be so. It
was all very well for a young unmarried man, who loved
the woods and hills beyond all things else, and who could
wait for advancement, but it was a sad place for one
who desired a wife. The ranger&#8217;s place was on the trail
and in the hills, and to bring a woman into these high
silences, into these lone reaches of forest and fell, would
be cruel. To bring children into them would be criminal.</p>
<p>All the next day, while Wetherford pottered about the
cabin or the yard, Cavanagh toiled at his papers, resolved
to leave everything in the perfect order which he
loved. Whenever he looked round upon his belongings,
each and all so redolent of the wilderness&mdash;he found them
very dear. His chairs (which he had rived out of slabs),
his guns, his robes, his saddles and their accoutrements&mdash;all
meant much to him. &#8220;Some of them must
go with me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And when I am settled down in
the old home I&#8217;ll have one room to myself which shall
be so completely of the mountain America that when
I am within it I can fancy myself back in the camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>He thought of South Africa as a possibility, and put
it aside, knowing well that no other place could have the
same indefinable charm that the Rocky Mountains possessed,
for the reason that he had come to them at his
most impressionable age. Then, too, the United States,
for all their faults, seemed merely an extension of the
English form of government.</p>
<p>Wetherford was also moving in deep thought, and at
last put his perplexity into a question. &#8220;What am I to
do? I&#8217;m beginning to feel queer. I reckon the chances
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
for my having smallpox are purty fair. Maybe I&#8217;d
better drop down to Sulphur and report to the authorities.
I&#8217;ve got a day or two before the blossoms will begin to
show on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh studied him closely. &#8220;Now don&#8217;t get to
thinking you&#8217;ve got it. I don&#8217;t see how you could attach
a germ. The high altitude and the winds up there ought
to prevent infection. I&#8217;m not afraid for myself, but if
you&#8217;re able, perhaps we&#8217;d better pull out to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later in the day Wetherford expressed deeper dejection.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see anything ahead of me anyhow,&#8221; he
confessed. &#8220;If I go back to the &#8216;pen&#8217; I&#8217;ll die of lung
trouble, and I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;m going to earn a living
in the city. Mebbe the best thing I could do would be
to take the pox and go under. I&#8217;m afraid of big towns,&#8221;
he continued. &#8220;I always was&mdash;even when I had money.
Now that I am old and broke I daren&#8217;t go. No city for
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh&#8217;s patience gave way. &#8220;But, man, you can&#8217;t
stay here! I&#8217;m packing up to leave. Your only chance
of getting out of the country is to go when I go, and in
my company.&#8221; His voice was harsh and keen, and the
old man felt its edge; but he made no reply, and this sad
silence moved Cavanagh to repentance. His irritability
warned him of something deeply changing in his own
nature.</p>
<p>Approaching the brooding felon, he spoke gently and
sadly. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for you, Wetherford, I sure am, but
it&#8217;s up to you to get clear away so that Lee will never
by any possible chance find out that you are alive. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
has a romantic notion of you as a representative of the
old-time West, and it would be a dreadful shock to her
if she knew you as you are. It&#8217;s hard to leave her, I
know, now that you&#8217;ve seen her, but that&#8217;s the manly
thing to do&mdash;the only thing to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re right&mdash;of course you&#8217;re right. But I wish
I could be of some use to her. I wish I could chore round
for the rest of my life, where I could kind o&#8217; keep watch
over her. I&#8217;d be glad enough to play the scullion in her
kitchen. But if you&#8217;re going to take her&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not,&#8221; protested Ross. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to leave
her right here. I can&#8217;t take her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wetherford looked at him with steady eyes, into which
a keen light leaped. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you intend to marry her?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross turned away. &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t&mdash;I mean it is impossible!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? Don&#8217;t tell me you&#8217;re already married?&#8221;
He said this with menacing tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not married, but&mdash;&#8221; He stopped without
making his meaning plain. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to leave the
country and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Wetherford caught him up. &#8220;I reckon I understand
what you mean. You consider Lize and me undersirable
parents&mdash;not just the kind you&#8217;d cut out of the herd of
your own free will. Well, that&#8217;s all right, I don&#8217;t blame
you so far as I&#8217;m concerned. But you can forget me,
consider me a dead one. I&#8217;ll never bother her nor
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh threw out an impatient hand. &#8220;It is impossible,&#8221;
he protested. &#8220;It&#8217;s better for her and better
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
for me that I should do so. I&#8217;ve made up my mind.
I&#8217;m going back to my own people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wetherford was thoroughly roused now. Some part
of his old-time fire seemed to return to him. He rose
from his chair and approached the ranger firmly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
seen you act like a man, Ross Cavanagh. You&#8217;ve been
a good partner these last few days&mdash;a son couldn&#8217;t have
treated me better&mdash;and I hate like hell to think ill of you;
but my girl loves you&mdash;I could see that. I could see her
lean to you, and I&#8217;ve got to know something else right now.
You&#8217;re going to leave here&mdash;you&#8217;re going to throw her
off. What I want to know is this: Do you leave her as
good as you found her? Come, now, I want an answer,
as one man to another.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh&#8217;s eyes met his with firm but sorrowful gaze.
&#8220;In the sense in which you mean, I leave her as I found
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man&#8217;s open hand shot out toward his rescuer.
&#8220;Forgive me, my lad,&#8221; he said, humbly; &#8220;for a minute
I&mdash;doubted you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross took his hand, but slowly replied: &#8220;It will be
hard for you to understand, when I tell you that I care
a great deal for your daughter, but a man like me&mdash;an
Englishman&mdash;cannot marry&mdash;or he ought not to marry&mdash;to
himself alone. There are so many others to consider&mdash;his
friends, his sisters&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Wetherford dropped his hand. &#8220;I see!&#8221; His tone
was despairing. &#8220;When I was young we married the
girls we loved in defiance of man, God, or the cupboard;
but you are not that kind. You may be right. I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
nothing but a debilitated old cow-puncher branded by
the State&mdash;a man who threw away his chance&mdash;but I
can tell you straight, I&#8217;ve learned that nothing but the
love of a woman counts. Furthermore,&#8221; and here his fire
flashed again, &#8220;I&#8217;d have killed you had you taken advantage
of my girl!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which would have been your duty,&#8221; declared Cavanagh,
wearily.</p>
<p>And in the face of this baffling mood, which he felt
but could not understand, the old man fell silent.</p>

<h2>XIII</h2>
<h3>CAVANAGH ASKS FOR HELP</h3>
</div>

<p>Lee Virginia waited with increasing impatience for
Ross Cavanagh&#8217;s return, expecting each noon to see
him appear at the door; but when three days passed
without word or sign from him, her uneasiness deepened
into alarm. The whole town was profoundly excited
over the murder, that she knew, and she began to fear
that some of the ranger&#8217;s enemies had worked their evil
will upon him.</p>
<p>With this vague fear in her heart, she went forth into
the street to inquire. One of the first men she met was
Sifton, who was sitting, as usual, outside the livery-barn
door, smiling, inefficient, content. Of him she asked:
&#8220;Have you seen Mr. Cavanagh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;I saw him yesterday, just after
dinner, down at the post-office. He was writing a letter
at the desk. Almost immediately afterward he mounted
and rode away. He was much cut up over his chief&#8217;s
dismissal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why has he not written to me,&#8221; she asked herself,
&#8220;and why should he have gone away without a word
of greeting, explanation, or good-bye? It would have
taken but a moment&#8217;s time to call at the door.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>The more she dwelt upon this neglect the more significant
it became. After the tender look in his eyes, after
the ardent clasp of his hand, the thought that he could
be so indifferent was at once a source of pain and self-reproach.</p>
<p>With childish frankness she went to Lize and told her
what she had learned, her eyes dim with hot tears.
&#8220;Ross came to town, and went away back to his cabin
without coming to see me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure he&#8217;s been here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Mr. Sifton saw him go. He came in, got some
letters at the post-office, and then rode away&mdash;&#8221; Her
voice broke as her disappointment and grief overcame
her.</p>
<p>Lize struggled to a sitting position. &#8220;There&#8217;s some
mistake about this. Ross Cavanagh never was the
whifflin&#8217; kind of man. You&#8217;ve got to remember he&#8217;s on
duty. Probably the letter was some order that carried
him right back to his work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if he had really cared, he could have ridden by
to say just a word; but he didn&#8217;t, he went away without
a sign, after promising to come.&#8221; She buried her face
in the coverlet of her mother&#8217;s bed, and wept in childish
grief and despair.</p>
<p>Lize was forced to acknowledge that the ranger&#8217;s
action was inexplicable, but she did her best to make
light of it. &#8220;He may have hurried to town on some
errand, and hadn&#8217;t a moment to spare. These are exciting
days for him, remember. He&#8217;ll be in to-morrow
sure.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>With a faint hope of this, the girl rose and went about
her daily tasks; but the day passed, and another, without
word or sign of the recreant lover, and each day brought
a deeper sense of loss, but her pride would not permit
her to show her grief.</p>
<p>Young Gregg, without knowing in the least the cause
of her troubled face, took this occasion to offer comfort.
His manner toward her had changed since she no longer
had a part in the management of the eating-house, and
for that reason she did not repulse him as sharply as
she had been wont to do. He really bore Cavanagh no
ill-will, and was, indeed, shrewd enough to understand
that Lee admired the ranger, and that his own courtship
was rather hopeless; nevertheless, he persisted, his respect
for her growing as he found her steadfast in her refusal
to permit any familiarity.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Miss Virginia,&#8221; he cried, as she was passing
him in the hall, &#8220;I can see you&#8217;re worried about Lize
(I mean your mother), and if I can be of any use I hope
you&#8217;ll call on me.&#8221; As she thanked him without enthusiasm,
he added: &#8220;How is she to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think she&#8217;s better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I see her?&#8221;</p>
<p>His tone was so earnest that the girl was moved to
say: &#8220;I&#8217;ll ask her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you would; I want to say something to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lize&#8217;s voice reached where they stood. &#8220;Come in,
Joe, the door&#8217;s open.&#8221;</p>
<p>He accepted her invitation rather awkwardly, but his
face was impassive as he looked down upon her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, how about it?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;What&#8217;s doing in
the town?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much of anything&mdash;except talk. The whole
country is buzzing over this dismissal of the Chief
Forester.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d better be doing something about that murder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are; they&#8217;re going up there in streams to see
where the work was done. The coroner&#8217;s inquest was
held yesterday.&#8221; He grinned. &#8220;&#8216;Parties came to their
death by persons unknown.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lize scowled. &#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder they don&#8217;t charge it up
to Ross Cavanagh or some other ranger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be a little too raw, even for this country.
They&#8217;re all feeling gay over this change in the forestry
head; but see here, don&#8217;t you want to get out for a ride?
I&#8217;ve got my new machine out here; it rides like silk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon a hearse is about my kind,&#8221; she replied,
darkly. &#8220;If you could take me up to Cavanagh&#8217;s cabin,
I&#8217;d go,&#8221; she added. &#8220;I want to see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can take you part way,&#8221; he instantly declared.
&#8220;But you&#8217;d have to ride a horse the last ten miles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t do it, Joe,&#8221; she sighed. &#8220;These last few
days I&#8217;ve been about as boneless as an eel. Funny the
way a fellow keeps going when he&#8217;s got something to do
that has to be done. I&#8217;ll tell you what, if you want to
take me and Lee up to Sulphur, I&#8217;ll go ye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing. What day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for a day or two. I&#8217;m not quite up to it just
now; but by Saturday I&#8217;ll be saddle-wise again.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<p>Joe turned joyously to Lee. &#8220;That will be great!
Won&#8217;t you come out for a spin this minute?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment Lee was tempted. Anything to get
away from this horrible little den and the people who
infested it was her feeling, but she distrusted Gregg, and
she knew that every eye in the town would be upon her
if she went, and, besides, Ross might return while she
was away. &#8220;No, not to-day,&#8221; she replied, finally; but
her voice was gentler than it had ever been to him.</p>
<p>The young fellow was moved to explain his position
to Lize. &#8220;You don&#8217;t think much of me, and I don&#8217;t
blame you. I haven&#8217;t been much use so far, but I&#8217;m
going to reform. If I had a girl like Lee Virginia to
live up to, I&#8217;d make a great citizen. I don&#8217;t lay my
arrest up against Cavanagh. I&#8217;m ready to pass that
by. And as for this other business&mdash;this free-range war
in which the old man is mixed up&mdash;I want you to know
that I&#8217;m against it. Dad knows his day is short; that&#8217;s
what makes him so hot. But he&#8217;s a bluff&mdash;just a fussy
old bluff. He knows he has no more right to the Government
grass than anybody else, but he&#8217;s going to get ahead
of the cattle-men if he can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he know who burned them sheep-herders?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course he knows, but ain&#8217;t going to say so. You
see, that old Basque who was killed was a monopolist,
too. He went after that grass without asking anybody&#8217;s
leave; moreover, he belonged to that Mexican-Dago
outfit that everybody hates. The old man isn&#8217;t crying
over that job; it&#8217;s money in his pocket. All the same it&#8217;s
too good a chance to put the hooks into the cattle-men,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
hence his offering a reward, and it looks as if something
would really be done this time. They say Neill Ballard
was mixed up in it, and that old guy that showed me the
sheep, but I don&#8217;t take much stock in that. Whoever
did it was paid by the cattle-men, sure thing.&#8221; The
young fellow&#8217;s tone and bearing made a favorable impression
upon Lize. She had never seen this side of him,
for the reason that he had hitherto treated her as a bartender.
She was acute enough to understand that her
social status had changed along with her release from
the cash-register, and she was slightly more reconciled,
although she could not see her way to providing a living
for herself and Lee. For all these reasons she was unwontedly
civil to Joe, and sent him away highly elated
with the success of his interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to let him take us up to Sulphur,&#8221; she said
to Lee. &#8220;I want to go to town.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee was silent, but a keen pang ran through her heart,
for she perceived in this remark by her mother a tacit
acknowledgment of Ross Cavanagh&#8217;s desertion of them
both. His invitation to them to come and camp with
him was only a polite momentary impulse. &#8220;I&#8217;m ready
to go,&#8221; she announced, at last. &#8220;I&#8217;m tired of this place.
Let us go to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the following morning, while they were busy packing
for this journey, Redfield rolled up to the door in
company with a young man in the uniform of a forester.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ask Reddy to come in,&#8221; commanded Lize. &#8220;I
want to see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Redfield met the girl at the door and presented his companion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
as &#8220;Mr. Dalton, District Forester.&#8221; Dalton was
a tall young fellow with a marked Southern accent. &#8220;Is
Cavanagh, the ranger, in town?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Lee replied, with effort; &#8220;he was here a few
days ago, but he&#8217;s gone back to the forest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Redfield studied the girl with keen gaze, perceiving
a passionate restraint in her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is your mother?&#8221; he asked, politely.</p>
<p>Lee smiled faintly. &#8220;She&#8217;s able to sit up. Won&#8217;t
you come in and see her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With pleasure,&#8221; assented Redfield, &#8220;but I want to
see you alone. I have something to say to you.&#8221; He
turned to his superior. &#8220;Just go into the café, Dalton.
I&#8217;ll see you in a moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee Virginia, hitherto ashamed of the house, the
furniture, the bed&mdash;everything&mdash;led the way without a
word of apology. It was all detached now, something
about to be left behind, like a bad garment borrowed in
a time of stress. Nothing mattered since Ross did not
return.</p>
<p>Lize, looking unwontedly refined and gentle, was
sitting in a big rocking-chair with her feet on a stool,
her eyes fixed on the mountains, which showed through
the open window. All the morning a sense of profound
change, of something passing, had oppressed her. Now
that she was about to leave the valley, its charm appealed
to her. She was tearing up a multitude of tiny roots of
whose existence she had hitherto remained unaware.
&#8220;I belong here,&#8221; she acknowledged, silently. &#8220;I&#8217;d be
homesick anywhere else on God&#8217;s earth. It&#8217;s rough and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
fly-bit, and all that, but so am I. I wouldn&#8217;t fit in anywhere
that Lee belonged.&#8221;</p>
<p>She acknowledged an especial liking for Redfield, and
she had penetration enough, worldly wisdom enough, to
know that Lee belonged more to his world than to her
own, and that his guidance and friendship were worth
more, much more, than that of all the rest of the country,
her own included. Therefore, she said: &#8220;I&#8217;m mighty
glad to see you, Reddy. Sit down. You&#8217;ve got to hear
my little spiel this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Redfield, perched on the edge of a tawdry chair, looked
about (like the charity visitor in a slum kitchen) without
intending to express disgust; but it was a dismal
room in which to be sick, and he pitied the woman the
more profoundly as he remembered her in the days
when &#8220;all out-doors&#8221; was none too wide for her.</p>
<p>Lize began, abruptly: &#8220;I&#8217;m down, but not out; in fact,
I was coming up to see you this afternoon. Lee and I
are just about pulling out for good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed! Why not go back with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can take the girl back if you want to, but now
that I&#8217;m getting my chance at you I may not go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Redfield&#8217;s tone was entirely cordial as he turned to
Lee. &#8220;I came hoping to carry you away. Will you
come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t unless mother goes,&#8221; she replied,
sadly.</p>
<p>Lize waved an imperative hand. &#8220;Fade away, child.
I want to talk with Mr. Redfield alone. Go, see!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus dismissed, Lee went back to the restaurant, where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
she found the Forester just sitting down to his luncheon.
&#8220;Mr. Redfield will be out in a few minutes,&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you join me?&#8221; he asked, in the frank accent
of one to whom women are comrades. &#8220;The Supervisor
has been telling me about you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took a seat facing him, feeling something refined
in his long, smoothly shaven, boyish face. He seemed
very young to be District Forester, and his eyes were a
soft brown with small wrinkles of laughter playing round
their corners.</p>
<p>He began at once on the subject of his visit. &#8220;Redfield
tells me you are a friend of Mr. Cavanagh&#8217;s; did you know
that he had resigned?&#8221;</p>
<p>She faced him with startled eyes. &#8220;No, indeed. Has
he done so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the Supervisor got a letter yesterday enclosing his
resignation, and asking to be relieved at once. And
when I heard of it I asked the Supervisor to bring me
down to see him; he&#8217;s too good a man to lose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did he resign?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He seemed very bitter over the chief&#8217;s dismissal;
but I hope to persuade him to stay in the service; he&#8217;s
too valuable a man to lose just now when the war is so
hot. I realize that his salary is too small; but there
are other places for him. Perhaps when he knows that
I have a special note to him from the chief he will
reconsider. He&#8217;s quite capable of the Supervisor&#8217;s position,
and Mr. Redfield is willing to resign in his favor.
I&#8217;m telling you all this because Mr. Redfield has told
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
me of your interest in Mr. Cavanagh&mdash;or rather his interest
in you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam Gregg, entering the door at this moment, came
directly to the Forester&#8217;s table. He was followed by
the sheriff, a bearded old man with a soiled collar and
a dim eye.</p>
<p>Gregg growled out, &#8220;You&#8217;d better keep your man
Cavanagh in the hills, Mr. Forester, or somebody will
take a pot-shot at him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s new?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His assistant is down with smallpox.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Smallpox</i>!&#8221; exclaimed Dalton.</p>
<p>Every jaw was fixed and every eye turned upon the
speaker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Smallpox!&#8221; gasped Lee.</p>
<p>Gregg resumed, enjoying the sensation he was creating.
&#8220;Yes, that Basque herder of mine&mdash;the one up
near Black Tooth&mdash;sent word he was sick, so I hunted
up an old tramp by the name of Edwards to take his
place. Edwards found the dago dying of pox, and
skipped out over the range, leaving him to die alone.
Cavanagh went up and found the dago dead, and took
care of him&mdash;result is, he&#8217;s full of germs, and has brought
his apprentice down with it, and both of &#8217;em must be
quarantined right where they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good heavens, man!&#8221; exclaimed Dalton. &#8220;This is
serious business. Are you sure it&#8217;s smallpox?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of my men came from there last night. I was
there myself on Monday, so was the deputy. The
sheriff missed Tom this morning, but I reached him by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
&#8217;phone, and Cavanagh admitted to us that the Basque
died of smallpox, and that he buried him with his own
hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheriff spoke up. &#8220;The criminal part of it is
this, Mr. Dalton: Cavanagh didn&#8217;t report the case when
he came down here, just went about leaving a trail of
poison. Why didn&#8217;t he report it? He should be
arrested.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; said Dalton. &#8220;Perhaps it wasn&#8217;t
pox, perhaps it was only mountain-fever. Cavanagh
is not the kind of man to involve others in a pestilence.
I reckon he knew it was nothing but a fever, and, not
wishing to alarm his friends, he just slid into town and
out again.&#8221;</p>
<p>A flash of light, of heat, of joy went through Lee&#8217;s
heart as she listened to Dalton&#8217;s defence of Cavanagh.
&#8220;That was the reason why he rode away,&#8221; she thought.
&#8220;He was afraid of bringing harm to us.&#8221; And this conviction
lighted her face with a smile, even while the
Forester continued his supposition by saying, &#8220;Of course,
proper precautions should be taken, and as we are going
up there, the Supervisor and I will see that a quarantine
is established if we find it necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gregg was not satisfied: &#8220;Cavanagh admitted to the
deputy and to me that he believed the case to be smallpox,
and said that he had destroyed the camp and everything
connected with it except the horse and the dog, and yet
he comes down here infectin&#8217; everybody he meets.&#8221; He
turned to Lee. &#8220;You&#8217;d better burn the bed he slept on.
He&#8217;s left a trail of germs wherever he went. I say the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
man is criminally liable, and should be jailed if he lives
to get back to town.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee&#8217;s mind was off now on another tangent. &#8220;Suppose
it is true?&#8221; she asked herself. &#8220;Suppose he has fallen
sick away up there, miles and miles from any nurse or
doctor&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something queer about the whole business,&#8221;
pursued Gregg. &#8220;For instance, who is this assistant he&#8217;s
got? Johnson said there was an old man in ranger
uniform potterin&#8217; round. Why didn&#8217;t he send word by
him? Why did he let me come to the door? He might
have involved <i>me</i> in the disease. I tell you, if you don&#8217;t
take care of him the people of the county will.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Forester looked grave. &#8220;If he <i>knew</i> it was pox
and failed to report it he certainly did wrong; but you
say he took care of this poor shepherd&mdash;nursed him till
he died, and buried him, taking all precautions&mdash;you
can&#8217;t complain of that, can you? That&#8217;s the act of a
good ranger and a brave man. <i>You</i> wouldn&#8217;t have
done it!&#8221; he ended, addressing Gregg. &#8220;Sickness up
there two full miles above sea-level is quite a different
proposition from sickness in Sulphur City or the Fork.
I shall not condemn Mr. Cavanagh till I hear his side
of the story.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee turned a grateful glance upon him. &#8220;You must
be right. I don&#8217;t believe Mr. Cavanagh would deceive
any one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll soon know the truth,&#8221; said Dalton, &#8220;for
I&#8217;m going up there. If the ranger has been exposed, he
must not be left alone.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t alone,&#8221; declared the sheriff. &#8220;Tom
&#8217;phoned me that he had an assistant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Swenson, I suppose,&#8221; said Redfield, who entered at
this moment. &#8220;Swenson is his assistant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see him myself,&#8221; Gregg continued, &#8220;but I
understood the deputy to say that he was an old man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Swenson is a young man,&#8221; corrected Redfield.</p>
<p>The sheriff insisted. &#8220;Tom said it was an old man&mdash;a
stranger to him&mdash;tall, smooth-shaven, not very strong,
he said&mdash;&#8217;peared to be a cook. He had helped nurse
the dago, so Tom said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very curious,&#8221; mused Redfield. &#8220;There
isn&#8217;t an old man in the service of this forest. There&#8217;s a
mistake somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; concluded Gregg, &#8220;that&#8217;s what he said. I
thought at first it might be that old hobo Edwards, but
this feller being in uniform and smooth-shaven&mdash;&#8221; His
face changed, his voice deepened. &#8220;Say, by the Lord! I
believe it was Edwards, and, furthermore, Edwards is the
convict that Texas marshal was after the other day, and
this man Cavanagh&mdash;your prize ranger&mdash;is harborin&#8217;
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What nonsense!&#8221; exclaimed Redfield.</p>
<p>The sheriff banged his hand upon the table. &#8220;That&#8217;s
the whole mystery. I see it all now. He&#8217;s up there concealing
this man. He&#8217;s given out this smallpox scare just
to keep the officers away from him. Now you&#8217;ve got
it!&#8221;</p>
<p>The thunder in his voice drew toward him all those
who remained in the dining-room, and Lee found herself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
ringed about by a dozen excited men. But she did not
flinch; she was too deeply concerned over Cavanagh&#8217;s
fate to be afraid, and, besides, Redfield and the Forester
were beside her.</p>
<p>The Supervisor was staggered by Gregg&#8217;s accusation,
and by certain confirmatory facts in his own possession,
but he defended Cavanagh bravely. &#8220;You&#8217;re crazy,&#8221;
he replied. &#8220;Why should Ross do such a foolish thing?
What is his motive? What interest would he have in
this man Edwards, whom you call a tramp? He can&#8217;t
be a relative and certainly not a friend of Cavanagh&#8217;s,
for you say he is a convict. Come, now, your hatred of
Cavanagh has gone too far.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gregg was somewhat cooled by this dash of reason, but
replied: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what relation he is, but these are
facts. He&#8217;s concealing an escaped convict, and he
knows it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dalton put in a quiet word. &#8220;What is the use of
shouting a judgment against a man like Cavanagh before
you know the facts? He&#8217;s one of the best and
ablest rangers on this forest. I don&#8217;t know why he has
resigned, but I&#8217;m sure&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he resigned?&#8221; asked Gregg, eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A damn good job for him. I was about to circulate
a petition to have him removed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If all the stockmen in the valley had signed a petition
against him, it wouldn&#8217;t have done any good,&#8221; replied
Dalton. &#8220;We know a good man when we see him.
I&#8217;m here to offer him promotion, not to punish him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p>Lee, looking about at the faces of these men, and seeing
disappointment in their faces, lost the keen sting of
her own humiliation. &#8220;In the midst of such a fight as
this, how can he give time or thought to me?&#8221; Painful as
the admission was, she was forced to admit that she was
a very humble factor in a very large campaign. &#8220;But
suppose he falls ill!&#8221; Her face grew white and set, and
her lips bitter. &#8220;That would be the final, tragic touch,&#8221;
she thought, &#8220;to have him come down of a plague from
nursing one of Sam Gregg&#8217;s sheep-herders.&#8221; Aloud
she said: &#8220;His resignation comes just in time, doesn&#8217;t
it? He can now be sick without loss to the service.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dalton answered her. &#8220;The Supervisor has not accepted
his resignation. On the contrary, I shall offer
him a higher position. His career as a forester is only
beginning. He would be foolish to give up the work
now, when the avenues of promotion are just opening. I
can offer him very soon the supervision of a forest.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they talked Lee felt herself sinking the while her
lover rose. It was all true. The Forester was right.
Ross was capable of any work they might demand of
him. He was too skilled, too intelligent, too manly, to
remain in the forest, heroic as its duties seemed.</p>
<p>Upon this discussion, Lize, hobbling painfully, appeared.
With a cry of surprise, Lee rose to meet her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, you must not do this!&#8221;</p>
<p>She waved her away. &#8220;I&#8217;m all right,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;barring the big marbles in my slippers.&#8221; Then she
turned to Dalton. &#8220;Now what&#8217;s it all about? Is it
true that Ross is down?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No. So far as we know, he is well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to find out. I don&#8217;t intend to set here
and have him up there without a cook or a nurse.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this moment a tall, fair young fellow, dressed in a
ranger&#8217;s uniform, entered the room, and made his way
directly to the spot where Lee, her mother, and Redfield
were standing. &#8220;Mr. Supervisor, Cavanagh has sent
me to tell you that he needs a doctor. He&#8217;s got a sick
man up at The Station, and he&#8217;s afraid it&#8217;s a case of
smallpox.&#8221; He turned to Lee. &#8220;He told me to tell
you that he would have written, only he was afraid to
even send a letter out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does he need?&#8221; asked Redfield.</p>
<p>&#8220;He needs medicine and food, a doctor, and he ought
to have a nurse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my job,&#8221; said Lize.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; said Redfield. &#8220;You&#8217;re not fit to ride
a mile. I won&#8217;t hear of your going.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wait and see. I&#8217;m goin&#8217;, and you can&#8217;t stop me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is the man with him?&#8221; asked the Forester.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. An old herder, he said. He said he
could take care of him all right for the present, but that
if he were taken down himself&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee&#8217;s mounting emotion broke from her in a little
cry. &#8220;Oh, Mr. Redfield, please let me go too! I want
to help&mdash;I must help!&#8221;</p>
<p>Redfield said: &#8220;I&#8217;ll telephone to Sulphur City and ask
Brooks to get a nurse, and come down as soon as possible.
Meanwhile I&#8217;ll go out to see what the conditions are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going too, I tell you,&#8221; announced Lize. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
had the cussed disease, and I&#8217;m not afraid of it. We had
three sieges of it in my family. You get me up there,
and I&#8217;ll do the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are ill?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was, but I&#8217;m not now.&#8221; Her voice was firmer
than it had been for days. &#8220;All I needed was something
to do. Ross Cavanagh has been like a son to me for two
years; he&#8217;s the one man in this country I&#8217;d turn my hand
over for&mdash;barrin&#8217; yourself, Reddy&mdash;and it&#8217;s my job to see
him through this pinch.&#8221;</p>
<p>In spite of all opposition, she had her way. Returning
to her room to get such clothing as she needed for her
stay in the hills, she waited for Redfield to send a carriage
to her. &#8220;I can&#8217;t ride a horse no more,&#8221; she sorrowfully
admitted.</p>
<p>Lee&#8217;s secret was no secret to any one there. Her wide
eyes and heaving breast testified to the profound stir in
her heart. She was in an anguish of fear lest Ross
should already be in the grip of his loathsome enemy.
That it had come to him by way of a brave and noble
act only made the situation the more tragic.</p>

<h2>XIV</h2>
<h3>THE PEST-HOUSE</h3>
</div>

<p>Cavanagh had kept a keen watch over Wetherford,
and when one night the old man began to complain of
the ache in his bones his decision was instant.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s up to us to move down
the valley to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wetherford protested that he would as soon die in the
hills as in the valley. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want Lee Virginia to
know, but if I seem liable to fade out, I&#8217;d like Lize to
be told that I didn&#8217;t forget her, and that I came back to
find out how she was. I hate to be a nuisance to you,
and so I&#8217;ll go down the valley if you say so.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he was about to turn in that night Ross heard a
horse cross the bridge, and with intent to warn the rider
of his danger, went to the door and called out: &#8220;Halt!
Who&#8217;s there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A friend,&#8221; replied the stranger, in a weak voice.</p>
<p>Ross permitted his visitor to ride up to the pole. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t ask you in,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a sick man inside.
Who are you, and what can I do for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this warning the rider dropped from
his saddle, and came into the light which streamed from
the door.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Dunn,&#8221; he began. &#8220;I&#8217;m from Deer
Creek.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you,&#8221; responded the ranger. &#8220;You&#8217;re that
rancher I saw working in the ditch the day I went to
telephone, and you&#8217;ve come to tell me something about
that murder.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other man broke into a whimper. &#8220;I&#8217;m a law-abiding
man, Mr. Cavanagh,&#8221; he began, tremulously.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve always kept the law, and never intended to have
anything to do with that business. I was dragged into it
against my will. I&#8217;ve come to you because you&#8217;re an
officer of the Federal law. You don&#8217;t belong here. I
trust you. You represent the President, and I want to
tell you what I know&mdash;only I want you to promise not to
bring me into it. I&#8217;m a man of a family, and I can&#8217;t bear
to have them know the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was deep agitation and complete sincerity in
the rancher&#8217;s choked and hesitant utterance, and Cavanagh
turned cold with a premonition of what he was
about to disclose. &#8220;I am not an officer of the law, Mr.
Dunn, not in the sense you mean, but I will respect your
wishes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that you are not an officer of the county law,
but you&#8217;re not a cattle-man. It is your business to keep
the peace in the wild country, and you do it, everybody
knows that; but I can&#8217;t trust the officers of this country,
they&#8217;re all afraid of the cowboys. You&#8217;re not afraid, and
you represent the United States, and I&#8217;ll tell you. I
can&#8217;t bear it any longer!&#8221; he wailed. &#8220;I must tell
somebody. I can&#8217;t sleep and I can&#8217;t eat. I&#8217;ve been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
like a man in a nightmare ever since. I had no hand
in the killing&mdash;I didn&#8217;t even see it done; but I knew it
was going to happen. I saw the committee appointed.
The meeting that decided it was held in my barn, but
I didn&#8217;t know what they intended to do. You believe
me, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; He peered up at Cavanagh with white
face and wild eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; replied the ranger; &#8220;I&#8217;ll protect you&mdash;if I
can. Go on. It&#8217;s your duty&mdash;tell all you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>The troubled man, after a little silence, resumed.
&#8220;Sometimes I feel that I&#8217;d be happier in jail than I am
walking about in the sunshine. I never dreamed civilized
men could do such deeds. I thought they were
only going to scare the herders and drive them out, as
they&#8217;ve done so many times before. I can see now that
they used my barn for a meeting-place because everybody
believed me to be a man of peace. And I am.
I&#8217;m over seventy years of age, Mr. Cavanagh, and I&#8217;ve
been a law-abiding citizen all my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>His mind, shattered by the weight of his ghastly secret,
was in confusion, and, perceiving this, Cavanagh began
to question him gently. One by one he procured the
names of those who voted to &#8220;deal with&#8221; the herders.
One by one he obtained also the list of those named on
&#8220;the Committee of Reprisal,&#8221; and as the broken man
delivered himself of these accusing facts he grew calmer.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t <i>believe</i>&mdash;that the men on that
committee could chop and burn&mdash;&#8221; His utterance failed
him again, and he fell silent abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;They must have been drunk&mdash;mad drunk,&#8221; retorted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
Cavanagh. &#8220;And yet who would believe that even
drink could inflame white men to such devil&#8217;s work?
When did you first know what had been done?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That night after it was done one of the men, my
neighbor, who was drawn on the committee, came to my
house and asked me to give him a bed. He was afraid
to go home. &#8216;I can&#8217;t face my wife and children,&#8217; he
said. He told me what he&#8217;d seen, and then when I remembered
that it had all been decided in my stable,
and the committee appointed there, I began to tremble.
You believe I&#8217;m telling the truth, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; he again
asked, with piteous accent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I believe you. You must tell this story to the
judge. It will end the reign of the cattle-men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no, I can&#8217;t do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must do that. It is your duty as a Christian
man and citizen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no; I&#8217;ll stay and help you&mdash;I&#8217;ll do anything
but that. I&#8217;m afraid to tell what I know. They would
burn me alive. I&#8217;m not a Western man. I&#8217;ve never
been in a criminal court. I don&#8217;t belong to this wild
country. I came out here because my daughter is not
strong, and now&mdash;&#8221; He broke down altogether, and
leaning against his horse&#8217;s side, sobbed pitifully.</p>
<p>Cavanagh, convinced that the old man&#8217;s mind was
too deeply affected to enable him to find his way back
over the rough trail that night, spoke to him gently. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
get you something to eat,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Sit down here, and
rest and compose yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wetherford turned a wild eye on the ranger as he reentered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
&#8220;Who&#8217;s out there?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Is it the
marshal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s only one of the ranchers from below; he&#8217;s
tired and hungry, and I&#8217;m going to feed him,&#8221; Ross
replied, filled with a vivid sense of the diverse characters
of the two men he was serving.</p>
<p>Dunn received the food with an eager hand, and after
he had finished his refreshment, Cavanagh remarked:
&#8220;The whole country should be obliged to you for your
visit to me. I shall send your information to Supervisor
Redfield.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t use my name,&#8221; he begged. &#8220;They will kill me
if they find out that I have told. We were all sworn to
secrecy, and if I had not seen that fire&mdash;that pile of
bodies&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, I know! It horrified me. It made me
doubt humanity,&#8221; responded Cavanagh. &#8220;We of the
North cry out against the South for lynching black rapers;
but here, under our eyes, goes on an equally horrible display
of rage over the mere question of temporary advantage,
over the appropriation of free grass, which is a
Federal resource&mdash;something which belongs neither to one
claimant nor to the other, but to the people, and should
be of value to the people. There is some excuse for
shooting and burning a man who violates a woman, but
what shall we say of those who kill and dismember men
over the possession of a plot of grass? You must bring
these men to punishment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dunn could only shiver in his horror and repeat his
fear. &#8220;They&#8217;ll kill me if I do.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></p>
<p>Cavanagh at last said: &#8220;You must not attempt to ride
back to-night. I can&#8217;t give you lodging in the cabin, because
my patient is sick of smallpox, but you can camp
in the barn till morning, then ride straight back to my
friend Redfield, and tell him what you&#8217;ve told me. He
will see that you are protected. Make your deposition
and leave the country, if you are afraid to remain.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the end the rancher promised to do this, but his tone
was that of a broken and distraught dotard. All the
landmarks of his life seemed suddenly shifted. All the
standards of his life hitherto orderly and fixed were now
confused and whirling, and Cavanagh, understanding
something of his plight, pitied him profoundly. It was
of a piece with this ironic story that the innocent man
should suffer madness and the guilty go calmly about
their business of grazing their cattle on the stolen grass.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the sufferings of his other patient were
increasing, and he was forced to give up all hope of getting
him down the trail next morning; and when Swenson,
the Forest Guard from the south Fork, knocked at the
door to say that he had been to the valley, and that the
doctor was coming up with Redfield and the District Forester,
Ross thanked him, but ordered him to go into camp
across the river, and to warn everybody to keep clear of
the cabin. &#8220;Put your packages down outside the door,&#8221;
he added, &#8220;and take charge of the situation on the outside.
I&#8217;ll take care of the business inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wetherford was in great pain, but the poison of the
disease had misted his brain, and he no longer worried
over the possible disclosure of his identity. At times he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
lost the sense of his surroundings and talked of his prison
life, or of the long ride northward. Once he rose in his
bed to beat off the wolves which he said were attacking
his pony.</p>
<p>He was a piteous figure as he struggled thus, and it
needed neither his relationship to Lee nor his bravery in
caring for the Basque herder to fill the ranger&#8217;s heart
with a desire to relieve his suffering. &#8220;Perhaps I should
have sent for Lize at once,&#8221; he mused, as the light brought
out the red signatures of the plague.</p>
<p>Once the old man looked up with wide, dark, unseeing
eyes and murmured, &#8220;I don&#8217;t seem to know
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a friend&mdash;my name is Cavanagh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t place you,&#8221; he sadly admitted. &#8220;I feel pretty
bad. If I ever get out of this place I&#8217;m going back to the
Fork; I&#8217;ll get a gold-mine, then I&#8217;ll go back and make
up for what Lize has gone through. I&#8217;m afraid to go
back now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; Ross soothingly agreed; &#8220;but you&#8217;ll have
to keep quiet till you get over this fever you&#8217;re suffering
from.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If Lize weren&#8217;t so far away, she&#8217;d come and nurse
me&mdash;I&#8217;m pretty sick. This stone-cutting&mdash;this inside
work is hell on an old cow-puncher like me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Swenson came back to say that probably Redfield
and the doctor would reach The Station by noon, and
thereafter, for the reason that Cavanagh expected their
coming, the hours dragged wofully. It was after one
o&#8217;clock before Swenson announced that two teams were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
coming with three men and two women in them. &#8220;They&#8217;ll
be here in half an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ranger&#8217;s heart leaped. Two women! Could one
of them be Lee Virginia? What folly&mdash;what sweet,
desperate folly! And the other&mdash;she could not be Lize&mdash;for
Lize was too feeble to ride so far. &#8220;Stop them on
the other side of the bridge,&#8221; he commanded. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
let them cross the creek on any pretext.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he stood in the door the flutter of a handkerchief,
the waving of a hand, made his pulses glow and his eyes
grow dim. It was Virginia!</p>
<p>Lize did not flutter a kerchief or wave a hand, but
when Swenson stopped the carriage at the bridge she
said: &#8220;No, you don&#8217;t! I&#8217;m going across. I&#8217;m going to
see Ross, and if he needs help, I&#8217;m going to roll up
my sleeves and take hold.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh saw her advancing, and, as she came near
enough for his voice to reach her, he called out: &#8220;Don&#8217;t
come any closer! Stop, I tell you!&#8221; His voice was
stern. &#8220;You must not come a step nearer. Go back
across the dead-line and stay there. No one but the
doctor shall enter this door. Now that&#8217;s final.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to help!&#8221; she protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you do; but I won&#8217;t have it. This quarantine
is real, and it goes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But suppose you yourself get sick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll cross <i>that</i> bridge when we get to it. I&#8217;m all
right so far, and I&#8217;ll call for help when I need it.&#8221;</p>
<p>His tone was imperative, and she obeyed, grumbling
about his youth and the value of his life to the service.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all very nice,&#8221; he replied; &#8220;but I&#8217;m in it, and
I don&#8217;t intend to expose you or any one else to the contagion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had it once,&#8221; she asserted.</p>
<p>He looked at her, and smiled in recognition of her
subterfuge.</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter; you&#8217;re ailing, and might take it again,
so toddle back. It&#8217;s mighty good of you, and of Lee,
to come&mdash;but there isn&#8217;t a thing you can do, and here&#8217;s
the doctor,&#8221; he added, as he recognized the young
student who passed for a physician in the Fork. He
was a beardless youth of small experience and no great
courage, and as he approached with hesitant feet he
asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure it&#8217;s smallpox?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh smiled. &#8220;The indications are all that
way. That last importation of Basques brought it
probably from the steerage of the ship. I&#8217;m told they&#8217;ve
had several cases over in the Basin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you been vaccinated?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; when I was in the army.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a certain comic relief in this long-distance
diagnosing of a &#8220;case&#8221; by a boy, and yet the tragic fact
beneath it all was that Wetherford was dying, a broken
and dishonored husband and father, and that his identity
must be concealed from his wife and daughter, who were
much more deeply concerned over the ranger than over
the desperate condition of his patient. &#8220;And this must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
continue to be so,&#8221; Cavanagh decided. And as he stood
there looking toward the girl&#8217;s fair figure on the bridge,
he came to the final, fixed determination never to speak
one word or make a sign that might lead to the dying
man&#8217;s identification. &#8220;Of what use is it?&#8221; he asked
himself. &#8220;Why should even Lize be made to suffer?
Wetherford&#8217;s poor misspent life is already over for her,
and for Lee he is only a dim memory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Redfield came near enough to see that the ranger&#8217;s
face, though tired, showed no sign of illness, and was
relieved. &#8220;Who is this old herder?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Hasn&#8217;t
he any relatives in the country?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He came from Texas, so he said. You&#8217;re not coming
in?&#8221; he broke off to say to the young physician, whom
Lize had shamed into returning to the cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I&#8217;ll have to,&#8221; he protested, weakly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see the need of it. The whole place reeks of the
poison, and you might carry it away with you. Unless
you insist on coming in, and are sure you can prevent
further contagion, I shall oppose your entrance. You
are in the company of others&mdash;I must consider their
welfare.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young fellow was relieved. &#8220;Well, so long as we
know what it is I can prescribe just as well right here,&#8221;
he said, and gave directions for the treatment, which
the ranger agreed to carry out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried to bring a nurse,&#8221; explained Redfield, &#8220;but I
couldn&#8217;t find anybody but old Lize who would come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame them,&#8221; replied Ross. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t a nice
job, even when you&#8217;ve got all the conveniences.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></p>
<p>His eyes, as he spoke, were on the figure of Lee, who
still stood on the bridge awed and worshipful, barred of
approach by Lize. &#8220;She shall not know,&#8221; he silently
vowed. &#8220;Why put her through useless suffering and
shame? Edward Wetherford&#8217;s disordered life is near its
end. To betray him to his wife and daughter would be
but the reopening of an old wound.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was stirred to the centre of his heart by the coming
of Lee Virginia, so sweet and brave and trustful. His
stern mood melted as he watched her there waiting,
with her face turned toward him, longing to help. &#8220;She
would have come alone if necessary,&#8221; he declared, with
a fuller revelation of the self-sacrificing depth of her
love, &#8220;and she would come to my side this moment if I
called her.&#8221;</p>
<p>To the District Forester he said no more than to Redfield.
&#8220;Edwards is evidently an old soldier,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;He was sent up here by Gregg to take the place of a
sick herder. He took care of that poor herder till he
died, and then helped me to bury him; now here he lies
a victim to his own sense of duty, and I shall not desert
him.&#8221; And to himself he added: &#8220;Nor betray him.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went back to his repulsive service sustained and
soothed by the little camp of faithful friends on the
other side of the stream. The tender grace of the girl&#8217;s
attitude, her air of waiting, of anxiety, of readiness to
serve, made him question the basis of his family pride.
He recognized in her the spirit of her sire, tempered,
sweetened, made more stable, by something drawn from
unknown sources. At the moment he felt that Lee was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
not merely his equal but his superior in purity of character
and in purpose. &#8220;What nonsense we talk of heredity, of
family,&#8221; he thought.</p>
<p>Standing over the wasted body of his patient, he asked
again: &#8220;Why let even Lize know? To her Ed Wetherford
is dead. She remembers him now as a young,
dashing, powerful horseman, a splendid animal, a picturesque
lover. Why wring her heart by permitting her
to see this wreck of what was once her pride?&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Wetherford himself, nothing mattered very
much. He spoke of the past now and then, but not in the
phrase of one who longs for the return of happy days&mdash;rather
in the voice of one who murmurs a half-forgotten
song. He called no more for his wife and child, and if he
had done so Cavanagh would have reasoned that the
call arose out of weakness, and that his better self, his
real self, would still desire to shield his secret from his
daughter.</p>
<p>And this was true, for during one of his clearest moments
Wetherford repeated his wish to die a stranger.
&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; out like the old-time West, a rag of what I
once was. Don&#8217;t let them know&mdash;put no name over
me&mdash;just say: &#8216;An old cow-puncher lies here.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh&#8217;s attempt to change his hopeless tone
proved unavailing. Enfeebled by his hardships and
his prison life, he had little reserve force upon which to
draw in fighting such an enemy. He sank soon after
this little speech into a coma which continued to hold
him in its unbroken grasp as night fell.</p>
<p>Meantime, seeing no chance of aiding the ranger,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
Redfield and the Forester prepared to return, but Lee,
reinforced by her mother, refused to accompany them.
&#8220;I shall stay here,&#8221; she said, &#8220;till he is safely out of it&mdash;till
I <i>know</i> that he is beyond all danger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Redfield did not urge her to return as vigorously as
Dalton expected him to do, but when he understood the
girl&#8217;s desire to be near her lover, he took off his hat and
bowed to her. &#8220;You are entirely in the right,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Here is where you belong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Redfield honored Lize for her sympathetic support of
her daughter&#8217;s resolution, and expressed his belief that
Ross would escape the plague. &#8220;I feel that his splendid
vigor, combined with the mountain air, will carry him
through&mdash;even if he should prove not to be immune. I
shall run up again day after to-morrow. I shall be very
anxious. What a nuisance that the telephone-line is not
extended to this point. Ross has been insisting on its
value for months.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee saw the doctor go with some dismay. Young as
he was, he was at least a reed to cling to in case the
grisly terror seized upon the ranger. &#8220;Mr. Redfield,
can&#8217;t you send a real doctor? It seems so horrible to
be left here without instructions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Forester, before going, again besought Cavanagh
not to abandon his work in the Forestry Service,
and intimated that at the proper time advancement
would be offered him. &#8220;The whole policy is but beginning,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;and a practical ranger with your
experience and education will prove of greatest value.&#8221;</p>
<p>To this Ross made reply. &#8220;At the moment I feel that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
no promise of advancement could keep me in this country
of grafters, poachers, and assassins. I&#8217;m weary of it,
and all it stands for. However, if I could aid in extending
the supervision of the public ranges and in stopping
forever this murder and burning that goes on outside the
forestry domain, I might remain in the West.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you accept the supervisorship of the Washakie
Forest?&#8221; demanded Dalton.</p>
<p>Taken by surprise, he stammered: &#8220;I might; but am I
the man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are. Your experience fits you for a position
where the fight is hot. The Washakie Forest is even
more a bone of contention than this. We have laid
out the lines of division between the sheep and the
cows, and it will take a man to enforce our regulations.
You will have the support of the best citizens. They will
all rally, with you as leader, and so end the warfare there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It can never end till Uncle Sam puts rangers over every
section of public lands and lays out the grazing lines as
we have done in this forest,&#8221; retorted Cavanagh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know; but to get that requires a revolution in the
whole order of things.&#8221; Then his fine young face lighted
up. &#8220;But we&#8217;ll get it. Public sentiment is coming our
way. The old order is already so eaten away that only
its shell remains.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be. If these assassins are punished I shall
feel hopeful of the change.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall recommend you for the supervisorship of the
Washakie Forest,&#8221; concluded Dalton, decisively. &#8220;And
so good-bye and good-luck.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></p>
<p>England, his blood relatives, even the Redfields, seemed
very remote to the ranger, as he stood in his door that
night and watched the sparkle of Swenson&#8217;s camp-fire
through the trees. With the realization that there waited
a brave girl of the type that loves single-heartedly, ready
to sacrifice everything to the welfare of her idealized subject,
he felt unworthy, selfish, vain.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I should fall sick she would insist on nursing me.
For her sake I must give Swenson the most rigid orders
not to allow her&mdash;no matter what happens&mdash;to approach.
I will not have her touched by this thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beside the blaze Lee and her mother sat for the most
part in silence, with nothing to do but to wait the issue
of the struggle going on in the cabin, so near and yet so
inaccessible to their will. It was as if a magic wall,
crystal-clear yet impenetrable, shut them away from the
man whose quiet heroism was the subject of their constant
thought.</p>
<p>To the girl this ride up into her lover&#8217;s world had been
both exalting and awesome&mdash;not merely because the
rough and precipitous road took her closer to her lover
while placing her farther from medical aid, but also because
it was so vast a world, so unpeopled and so beautiful.</p>
<p>It was marvellous, as the dusk fell and the air nipped
keen, to see how Lize Wetherford renewed her youth.
The excitement seemed to have given her a fresh hold on
life. She was wearied but by no means weakened by her
ride, and ate heartily of the rude fare which Swenson set
before her. &#8220;This is what I needed,&#8221; she exultantly said;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
&#8220;the open air and these trout. I feel ten years younger
already. Many&#8217;s the night I&#8217;ve camped on the range
with your father with nothing but a purp-tent to cover us
both, and the wolves howling round us. I&#8217;d feel pretty
fairly gay if it weren&#8217;t for Ross over there in that cabin
playin&#8217; nurse and cook all by his lonesomeness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee expressed a deep satisfaction from the fact of their
nearness. &#8220;If he is ill we can help him,&#8221; she reiterated.</p>
<p>She had put behind her all the doubt and fear which
his abrupt desertion of her had caused, and, though he
had not been able to speak a word to her, his self-sacrifice
had made amends. She excused it all as part of his
anxious care. Whatever the mood of that other day
had been, it had given way to one that was lofty and
deeply altruistic. Her one anxiety now was born of a
deepening sense of his danger, but against this she
bent the full strength of her will. &#8220;He shall not die,&#8221;
she declared beneath her breath. &#8220;God will not permit
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a touch of frost in the air as they went to their
beds, and, though she shivered, Lize was undismayed.
&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing the matter with my heart,&#8221; she exulted.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe there was anything really serious the
matter with me, anyway. I reckon I was just naturally
grouchy and worried over you and Ross.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee Virginia was now living a romance stranger and
more startling than any she had ever read. In imagination
she was able to look back and down upon the Fork
as if she had been carried into another world&mdash;a world
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
that was at once primeval yet peaceful: a world of
dreaming trees, singing streams, and silent peaks; a
realm in which law and order reigned, maintained by one
determined young man whose power was derived from
the President himself. She felt safe&mdash;entirely safe&mdash;for
just across the roaring mountain torrent the two intrepid
guardians of the forest were encamped. One of them, it
is true, came of Swedish parentage and the other was a
native of England, but they were both American in the
high sense of being loyal to the Federal will, and she
trusted them more unquestioningly than any other men
in all that West save only Redfield. She had no doubt
there were others equally loyal, equally to be trusted, but
she did not know them.</p>
<p>She rose to a complete understanding of Cavanagh&#8217;s
love for &#8220;the high country&#8221; and his enthusiasm for the
cause, a cause which was able to bring together the
student from Yale and the graduates of Bergen and of
Oxford, and make them comrades in preserving the trees
and streams of the mountain States against the encroachments
of some of their own citizens, who were openly,
short-sightedly, and cynically bent upon destruction,
spoliation, and misuse.</p>
<p>She had listened to the talk of the Forester and the
Supervisor, and she had learned from them that Cavanagh
was sure of swift advancement, now that he had
shown his courage and his skill; and the thought that
he might leave the State to take charge of another
forest brought her some uneasiness, for she and Lize
had planned to go to Sulphur City. She had consented
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
to this because it still left to her the possibility of occasionally
seeing or hearing from Cavanagh. But the
thought that he might go away altogether took some of
the music out of the sound of the stream and made the
future vaguely sad.</p>

<h2>XV</h2>
<h3>WETHERFORD PASSES ON</h3>
</div>

<p>For the next two days Cavanagh slept but little, for
his patient grew steadily worse. As the flame of his
fever mounted, Wetherford pleaded for air. The ranger
threw open the doors, admitting freely the cool, sweet
mountain wind. &#8220;He might as well die of a draught as
smother,&#8221; was his thought; and by the use of cold cloths
he tried to allay the itching and the pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I am doing may be all wrong,&#8221; he admitted to
Swenson, who came often to lean upon the hitching-pole
and offer aid. &#8220;I have had no training as a nurse, but
I must be doing something. The man is burning up,
and hasn&#8217;t much vitality to spare. I knew a ranger had
to be all kinds of things, cowboy, horse-doctor, axe-man,
carpenter, surveyor, and all the rest of it, but I didn&#8217;t
know that he had to be a trained nurse in addition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you feel yourself?&#8221; asked his subordinate,
anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just tired; nothing more. I reckon I am going to
escape. I should be immune, but you never can
tell. The effect of vaccination wears off after a few
years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The women folks over there are terribly worried, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
the old lady has made me promise to call her in if you
show the slightest signs of coming down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell her to rest easy. I am keeping mighty close
watch over myself, and another night will tell the story
so far as the old man is concerned. I wish I had a real
doctor, but I don&#8217;t expect any. It is a long hard climb
up here for one of those tenderfeet.&#8221;</p>
<p>He returned to his charge, and Swenson walked slowly
away, back to the camp, oppressed with the sense of his
utter helplessness.</p>
<p>Again and again during the day Lee Virginia went to
the middle of the bridge, which was the dead-line, and
there stood to catch some sign, some wave of the hand
from her lover. Strange courtship! and yet hour by hour
the tie which bound these young souls together was
strengthened. She cooked for him in the intervals
of her watch and sent small pencilled notes to him,
together with the fish and potatoes, but no scrap
of paper came back to her&mdash;so scrupulous was Cavanagh
to spare her from the faintest shadow of danger.</p>
<p>Swenson brought verbal messages, it was true, but they
were by no means tender, for Cavanagh knew better than
to intrust any fragile vessel of sentiment to this stalwart
young woodsman. Now that Lee knew the mysterious
old man was dying, she longed for his release&mdash;for his
release would mean her lover&#8217;s release. She did not
stop to think that it would be long, very long, before she
could touch Cavanagh&#8217;s hand or even speak with him
face to face. At times under Swenson&#8217;s plain speaking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
she grew faint with the horror of the struggle which was
going on in that silent cabin.</p>
<p>This leprous plague, this offspring of crowded and
dirty tenements and of foul ship-steerages, seemed
doubly unholy here in the clean sanity of the hills. It
was a profanation, a hideous curse. &#8220;If it should seize
upon Ross&mdash;&#8221; Words failed to express her horror, her
hate of it. &#8220;Oh God, save him!&#8221; she prayed a hundred
times each day.</p>
<p>Twice in the night she rose from her bed to listen, to
make sure that Cavanagh was not calling for help.
The last time she looked out, a white veil of frost lay on
the grass, and the faint light of morning was in the east,
and in the exquisite clarity of the air, in the serene hush of
the dawn, the pestilence appeared but as the ugly
emanation of disordered sleep. The door of the ranger&#8217;s
cabin stood open, but all was silent. &#8220;He is snatching a
half-hour&#8217;s sleep,&#8221; she decided.</p>
<p>If the guard had carried in his mind the faintest intention
of permitting Lize to go to Cavanagh&#8217;s aid, that
intention came to no issue, for with the coming of the
third night Wetherford was unconscious and unrecognizable
to any one who had known him in the days of
&#8220;the free range.&#8221; Lithe daredevil in those days,
expert with rope and gun, he was as far from this scarred
and swollen body as the soaring eagle is from the carrion
which he sees and scorns.</p>
<p>He was going as the Wild West was going, discredited,
ulcerated, poisoned, incapable of rebirth, yet carrying
something fine to his grave. He had acted the part of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
brave man, that shall be said of him. He had gone to the
rescue of the poor Basque, instinctively, with the same
reckless disregard of consequences to himself which
marked his character when as a cow-boss on the range
he had set aside the most difficult tasks for his own rope
or gun. His regard for the ranger into whose care he was
now about to commit his wife and daughter, persisted in
spite of his suffering. In him was his hope, his stay.
Once again, in a lucid moment, he reverted to the
promise which he had drawn from Cavanagh.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I go, you must take care&mdash;of my girl&mdash;take care
of Lize, too. Promise me that. Do you promise?&#8221; he
insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I promise&mdash;on honor,&#8221; Ross repeated, and, with a
faint pressure of his hand (so slender and weak), Wetherford
sank away into the drowse which deepened hour
by hour, broken now and then by convulsions, which
wrung the stern heart of the ranger till his hands trembled
for pity.</p>
<p>All day, while the clouds sailed by, white as snow and
dazzlingly pure, while the stream roared with joy of exploration,
and the sunshine fell in dazzling floods upon
the world, the ranger bent above his ward or walked
the floor of his cabin marvelling that the air and light
of this high place should be so powerless to check the
march of that relentless plague. It seemed that to open
the doors, to fill the room with radiance, must surely kill
the mutinous motes which warred upon the tortured
body. But in the midst of nature&#8217;s sovereign charm
the reek of the conflict went up; and he wondered whether
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
even the vigor which his outdoor life had built up could
withstand the strain another day.</p>
<p>Once Lee Virginia approached close enough to hear
his voice as he warned her to go back. &#8220;You can do
nothing,&#8221; he called to her. &#8220;Please go away.&#8221; His
face was haggard with weariness, and her heart filled
with bitter resentment to think that this repulsive warfare,
this painful duty, should be thrust upon one so fine.</p>
<p>He himself felt as though his youth were vanishing, and
that in these few days he had entered upon the sober, care-filled
years of middle life. The one sustaining thought,
his one allurement, lay in the near presence of the girl
to whom he could call, but could not utter one tender word.
She was there where he could see her watching, waiting
at the bridge. &#8220;The sound of the water helps me bear
the suspense,&#8221; she said to Swenson, and the occasional
sight of her lover, the knowledge that he was still unbroken,
kept her from despair.</p>
<p>The day was well advanced when the sound of rattling
pebbles on the hill back of his cabin drew his attention,
and a few moments later a man on a weary horse rode
up to his door and dropped heavily from the saddle.
He was a small, dark individual, with spectacles, plainly
of the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beware! Smallpox!&#8221; called Ross, as his visitor
drew near the door.</p>
<p>The new-comer waved his hand contemptuously.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve had it. Are you Ross Cavanagh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Hartley. I represent the Denver
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
<i>Round-up</i>. I&#8217;m interested in this sheep-herder killing&mdash;merely
as a reporter,&#8221; he added, with a fleeting smile.
&#8220;Did you know old man Dunn, of Deer Creek, had
committed suicide?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh started, and his face set. &#8220;No!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They found him shot through the neck, and dying&mdash;this
morning. As he was gasping his last breath, he
said, &#8216;The ranger knows,&#8217; and when they asked, &#8216;What
ranger,&#8217; he said, &#8216;Cavanagh.&#8217; When I heard that I
jumped a horse and beat &#8217;em all over here. Is this
true? Did he tell you who the murderers are?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh did not answer at once. He was like a
man caught on a swaying bridge, and his first instinct
was to catch the swing, to get his balance. &#8220;Wait a
minute! What is it all to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again that peculiar grin lighted the small man&#8217;s dark,
unwholesome face. &#8220;It&#8217;s a fine detective stunt, and
besides it means twenty dollars per column and mebbe
a &#8216;boost.&#8217; I can&#8217;t wait, you can&#8217;t wait! It&#8217;s up to us to
strike <i>now</i>! If these men knew you have their names
they&#8217;d hike for Texas or the high seas. Come now!
Everybody tells me you&#8217;re one of these idealistic highbrow
rangers who care more for the future of the West
than most natural-born Westerners. What&#8217;s your plan?
If you&#8217;ll yoke up with me we&#8217;ll run these devils into the
earth and win great fame, and you&#8217;ll be doing the whole
country a service.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ranger studied the small figure before him with
penetrating gaze. There was deliberative fearlessness
in the stranger&#8217;s face and eyes, and notwithstanding his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
calm, almost languid movement, restless energy could
be detected in his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your plan?&#8221; the ranger asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get ourselves deputized by the court, and jump these
men before they realize that there&#8217;s anything doing.
They count the whole country on their side, but they&#8217;re
mistaken. They&#8217;ve outdone themselves this time, and
a tremendous reaction has set in. Everybody knows
you&#8217;ve held an even hand over these warring Picts and
Scots, and the court will be glad to deputize you to
bring them to justice. The old sheriff is paralyzed. Everybody
knows that the assassins are prominent cattle-ranchers,
and yet no one dares move. It&#8217;s up to you
fellows, who represent law and order, to act quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh followed him with complete comprehension,
and a desire to carry out the plan seized upon him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d do it if I could,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it happens I am
nursing a sick man. I am, perhaps, already exposed
to the same disease. I can&#8217;t leave here for a week or
more. It would not be right for me to expose others&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about that. Take a hot bath, fumigate
your clothing, shave your head. I&#8217;ll fix you up, and I&#8217;ll
get some one to take your place.&#8221; Catching sight of
Swenson and Lize on the bridge, he asked: &#8220;Who are
those people? Can&#8217;t they take your nursing job?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; answered Cavanagh, bluntly. &#8220;It&#8217;s no use,
I can&#8217;t join you in this&mdash;at least, not now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll give me the names which Dunn gave
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t do that. I shall tell the Supervisor, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
he can act as he sees fit&mdash;for the present I&#8217;m locked up
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other man looked the disappointment he felt.
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you don&#8217;t feel like opening up. You know
perfectly well that nothing will ever be done about this
thing unless the press insists upon it. It&#8217;s up to you and
me (me representing &#8216;the conscience of the East&#8217;&#8221;&mdash;here
he winked an eye&mdash;&#8220;and you Federal authority) to
do what we can to bring these men to their punishment.
Better reconsider. I&#8217;m speaking now as a citizen as
well as a reporter.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was much truth in what he said, but Cavanagh
refused to go further in the matter until he had consulted
with Redfield.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; replied Hartley, &#8220;that&#8217;s settled. By-the-way,
who is your patient?&#8221;</p>
<p>Eloquently, concisely, Ross told the story. &#8220;Just a
poor old mounted hobo, a survival of the cowboy West,&#8221;
he said; &#8220;but he had the heart of a hero in him, and I&#8217;m
doing my best to save him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep him in the dark, that&#8217;s the latest theory&mdash;or
under a red light. White light brings out the ulcers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He hates darkness; that&#8217;s one reason why I&#8217;ve opened
the doors and windows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All wrong! According to Finsen, he wouldn&#8217;t pit
in the dark. However, it doesn&#8217;t matter on a cowboy.
You&#8217;ve a great story yourself. There&#8217;s a fine situation
here which I&#8217;ll play up if you don&#8217;t object.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh smiled. &#8220;Would my objection have any
weight?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></p>
<p>The reporter laughed. &#8220;Not much; I&#8217;ve got to carry
back some sort of game. Well, so long! I must hit the
trail over the hill.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh made civil answer, and returned to his
patient more than half convinced that Hartley was right.
The &#8220;power of the press&#8221; might prove to be a very real
force in this pursuit.</p>
<p>As the journalist was about to mount his horse he
discovered Lee Virginia on the other side of the creek.
&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said he, &#8220;I wonder what this pretty maiden
means?&#8221; And, dropping his bridle-rein again, he
walked down to the bridge.</p>
<p>Swenson interposed his tall figure. &#8220;What do you
want?&#8221; he asked, bluntly. &#8220;You don&#8217;t want to get
too close. You&#8217;ve been talking to the ranger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hartley studied him coolly. &#8220;Are you a ranger,
too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, only a guard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you leaving Cavanagh to play it alone in
there?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee explained. &#8220;He won&#8217;t let any of us come near
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite right,&#8221; retorted Hartley, promptly. &#8220;They
say smallpox has lost its terrors, but when you&#8217;re eight
hours&#8217; hard trail from a doctor, or a hospital, it&#8217;s still
what I&#8217;d call a formidable enemy. However, Cavanagh&#8217;s
immune, so he says.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know that,&#8221; Lee said, and her hands came
together in a spasm of fear. &#8220;Are you a doctor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m only a newspaper man; but I&#8217;ve had a lot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
of experience with plagues of all sorts&mdash;had the yellow
fever in Porto Rico, and the typhoid in South Africa;
that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m out here richochetting over the hills. But
who are you, may I ask? You look like the rose of
Sharon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Lee Wetherford,&#8221; she answered, with
childish directness, for there was something compelling
in the man&#8217;s voice and eyes. &#8220;And this is my mother.&#8221;
She indicated Lize, who was approaching.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> are not out here for your health,&#8221; he stated,
rather thoughtfully. &#8220;How happens it you&#8217;re here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was born here&mdash;in the Fork.&#8221;</p>
<p>His face remained expressionless. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe
it. Can such maidens come out of Roaring Fork&mdash;nit!
But I don&#8217;t mean that. What are you doing up here in
this wilderness?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lize took a part in the conversation. &#8220;Another inspector?&#8221;
she asked, as she lumbered up.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s me,&#8221; he replied; &#8220;Sherlock Holmes, Vidocque,
all rolled into one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother,&#8221; again volunteered Lee.</p>
<p>Hartley&#8217;s eyes expressed incredulity; but he did not
put his feelings into words, for he perceived in Lize a
type with which he was entirely familiar&mdash;one to be
handled with care. &#8220;What are you two women doing
here? Are you related to one of these rangers?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lize resented this. &#8220;You&#8217;re asking a good many
questions, Mr. Man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my trade,&#8221; was the unabashed reply, &#8220;and
I&#8217;m not so old but that I can rise to a romantic situation.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
Thereupon he dropped all direct interrogation, and with
an air of candor told the story of his mission. Lize,
entirely sympathetic, invited him to lunch, and he was
soon in possession of their story, even to the tender relationship
between Lee Virginia and the plague-besieged
forest ranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not so mighty disinterested,&#8221; he said, referring
to his paper. &#8220;<i>The Round-up</i> represents the New West
in part, but to us the New West means opportunity
to loot water-sites and pile up unearned increment.
Oh yes, we&#8217;re on the side of the fruit and alfalfa grower,
because it pays. If the boss of my paper happened to
be in the sheep business, as Senator Blank White is, we
would sing a different tune. Or if I were a Congressman
representing a district of cattle-men, I&#8217;d be very
slow about helping to build up any system that would
make me pay for my grass. As it is, I&#8217;m commissioned
to make it hot for the ranchers that killed those dagoes,
and I&#8217;m going to do it. If this country had a man like
Cavanagh for sheriff, we&#8217;d have the murderers in two
days. He knows who the butchers are, and I&#8217;d like his
help; but he&#8217;s nailed down here, and there&#8217;s no hope of
his getting away. A few men like him could civilize this
cursed country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thereupon he drew from three pairs of lips a statement
of the kind of man Ross Cavanagh was, but most significant
of all were the few words of the girl, to whom this
man of the pad and pencil was a magician, capable of
exalting her hero and of advancing light and civilization
by the mere motion of his hand. She liked him, and grew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
more and more willing to communicate, and he, perceiving
in her something unusual, lingered on questioning.
Then he rose. &#8220;I must be going,&#8221; he said to Lee.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve given me a lovely afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee Virginia was all too ignorant of the ways of reporters
to resent his note-taking, and she accepted his
hand, believing him to be the sincere admirer of her
ranger. &#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going back to Sulphur to spread the report of
Cavanagh&#8217;s quarantine.&#8221; Again that meaning smile. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t want any other newspaper men mixed up in my
game. I&#8217;m lonesome Ned in stunts like this, and I hope
if they <i>do</i> come up you&#8217;ll be judiciously silent. Good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon after the reporter left, Cavanagh called to Swenson:
&#8220;The old man can&#8217;t last through another such a night
as last night was, and I wish you would persuade Mrs.
Wetherford and her daughter to return to the valley.
They can do nothing here&mdash;absolutely <i>nothing</i>. Please
say that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Swenson repeated his commands with all the emphasis
he could give them, but neither Lize nor Lee would
consent to go. &#8220;It would be heathenish to leave him
alone in this lonesome hole,&#8221; protested Lize.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall stay till he is free,&#8221; added Lee. And with uneasy
heart she crossed the bridge and walked on and on
toward the cabin till she was close enough to detect the
lines of care on her lover&#8217;s haggard face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; he called, sharply. &#8220;Keep away. Why don&#8217;t
you obey me? Why don&#8217;t you go back to the valley?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Because I will not leave you alone&mdash;I can&#8217;t! Please
let me stay!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg of you go back.&#8221;</p>
<p>The roar of the stream made it necessary to speak
loudly, and he could not put into his voice the tenderness
he felt at the moment, but his face was knotted with pain
as he asked: &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see you add to my uneasiness&mdash;my
pain?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re so anxious about you,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;It seems
as though we should be doing something to help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He understood, and was grateful for the tenderness
which brought her so near to him, but he was forced to
be stern.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing you can do&mdash;nothing more than you
are doing. It helps me to know that you are there, but
you must not cross the bridge. Please go back!&#8221; There
was pleading as well as command in his voice, and with a
realization of the passion his voice conveyed, she retraced
her steps, her heart beating quickly with the joy which
his words conveyed.</p>
<p>At sunset Redfield returned, bringing with him medicines
but no nurse. &#8220;Nobody will come up here,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I reckon Ross is doomed to fight it out alone.
The solitude, the long trail, scares the bravest of them
away. I tried and tried&mdash;no use. Eleanor would have
come, of course&mdash;demanded to come; but I would not
permit that. She commissioned me to bring you both
down to the ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee Virginia thanked him, but reiterated her wish to
stay until all possible danger to Cavanagh was over.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></p>
<p>Redfield crossed the bridge, and laid the medicines
down outside the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;The nurse from Sulphur refused to come when she
found that her patient was in a mountain cabin. I&#8217;m
sorry, old man; I did the best I could.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; replied Cavanagh. &#8220;I&#8217;m still free
from any touch of fever. I&#8217;m tired, of course, but good
for another night of it. My main anxiety concerns Lee&mdash;get
her to go home with you if you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do the best I can,&#8221; responded Redfield, &#8220;but
meanwhile you must <i>not</i> think of getting out of the
Forest Service. I have some cheering news for you.
The President has put a good man into the chief&#8217;s
place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh&#8217;s face lighted up. &#8220;That&#8217;ll help some,&#8221; he
exclaimed; &#8220;but who&#8217;s the man?&#8221;</p>
<p>Redfield named him. &#8220;He was a student under the
chief, and the chief says he&#8217;s all right, which satisfies
me. Furthermore, he&#8217;s a real forester, and not a
political jobber or a corporation attorney.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; repeated Cavanagh; &#8220;and yet&mdash;&#8221; he
said, sadly, &#8220;it leaves the chief out just the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, the chief is not out. He&#8217;s where he can fight
for the idea to better advantage than when he was a
subordinate under another man. Anyhow, he asks us
all to line up for the work and not to mind him. The
work, he says, is bigger than any man. Here&#8217;s that
resignation of yours,&#8221; he said, taking Cavanagh&#8217;s letter
from his pocket; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t put it on file. What shall I
do with it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Throw it to me,&#8221; said Cavanagh, curtly.</p>
<p>Redfield tossed it over the hitching-pole, and Ross
took it up, looked at it for a moment in silence, then tore
it into bits and threw it on the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are your orders, Mr. Supervisor?&#8221; he asked,
with a faint, quizzical smile around his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing you can do but take care of this man.
But as soon as you are able to ride again, I&#8217;ve got some
special work for you. I want you to join with young
Bingham, the ranger on Rock Creek, and line up the
&#8216;Triangle&#8217; cattle. Murphy is reported to have thrown
on the forest nearly a thousand head more than his
permit calls for. I want you to see about that. Then
complete your maps so that I can turn them in on
the first of November, and about the middle of December
you are to take charge of this forest in my stead.
Eleanor has decided to take the children abroad for a
couple of years, and as I am to be over there part of the
time, I don&#8217;t feel justified in holding down the Supervisor&#8217;s
position. I shall resign in your favor. Wait,
now!&#8221; he called, warningly. &#8220;The District Forester
and I framed all this up as we rode down the hill yesterday,
and it goes. Oh yes, there&#8217;s one thing more. Old
man Dunn&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you learn it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A reporter came boiling over the ridge about noon
to-day, wanting me to give him the names which Dunn
had given me. I was strongly tempted to do as he asked
me to&mdash;you know these newspaper men are sometimes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
the best kind of detectives for running down criminals;
but on second thought I concluded to wait until I had
discussed the matter with you. I haven&#8217;t much faith in
the county authorities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ordinarily I would have my doubts myself,&#8221; replied
Redfield, &#8220;but the whole country is roused, and
we&#8217;re going to round up these men this time, sure. The
best men and the big papers all over the West are demanding
an exercise of the law, and the reward we have
offered&mdash;&#8221; He paused, suddenly. &#8220;By-the-way, that
reward will come to you if you can bring about the arrest
of the criminals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The reward should go to Dunn&#8217;s family,&#8221; replied the
ranger, soberly. &#8220;Poor chap, he&#8217;s sacrificed himself for
the good of the State.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true. His family is left in bad shape&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh broke off the conversation suddenly. &#8220;I
must go back to&mdash;&#8221; he had almost said &#8220;back to
Wetherford.&#8221; &#8220;My patient needs me!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;How does he seem?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s surely dying. In my judgment he can&#8217;t last
the night, but so long as he&#8217;s conscious it&#8217;s up to me to be
on the spot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Redfield walked slowly back across the river, thinking
on the patient courage of the ranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t the obvious kind of thing, but it&#8217;s courage all
the same,&#8221; he said to himself.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Lize and Virginia, left alone beside the
fire, had drawn closer together.</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s face, so sweet and so pensive, wrought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
strongly upon the older woman&#8217;s sympathy. Something
of her own girlhood came back to her. Being freed from
the town and all its associations, she became more considerate,
more thoughtful. She wished to speak, and
yet she found it very hard to begin. At last she said,
with a touch of mockery in her tone: &#8220;You like Ross
Cavanagh almost as well as I do myself, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl flushed a little, but her eyes remained steady.
&#8220;I would not be here if I did not,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither would I. Well, now, I have got something
to tell you&mdash;something I ought to have told you long ago&mdash;something
that Ross ought to know. I intended to
tell you that first day you came back, but I couldn&#8217;t somehow
get to it, and I kept putting it off and putting it off
till&mdash;well, then I got fond of you, and every day made it
harder.&#8221; Here she made her supreme effort. &#8220;Child,
I&#8217;m an old bluff. I&#8217;m not your mother at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee stared at her in amazement. &#8220;What do you
mean?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean your real mother died when you was a tiny
little babe. You see, I was your father&#8217;s second wife;
in fact, you weren&#8217;t a year old when we married. Ed
made me promise never to let you know. We were to
bring you up just the same as if you was a child to both
of us. Nobody knows but Reddy. I told him the day
we started up here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s mind ran swiftly over the past as she listened.
The truth of the revelation reached her instantly, explaining
a hundred strange things which had puzzled
her all her life. The absence of deep affection between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
herself and Lize was explained. Their difference in
habit, temperament, thought&mdash;all became plain. &#8220;But
my mother!&#8221; she said, at last. &#8220;Who <i>was</i> my mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw her. You see, Ed came into the country
bringing you, a little motherless babe. He always said
your mother was a fine woman, but I never so much as
saw a picture of her. She was an educated woman, he
said&mdash;a Southern woman&mdash;and her name was Virginia,
but that&#8217;s about all I can tell you of her. Now, I am
going to let Ross know all of this as soon as I can. It
will make a whole lot of difference in what he thinks of
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She uttered all this much as a man would have done,
with steady voice and with bright eyes, but Lee Virginia
could feel beneath her harsh inflections the deep emotion
which vibrated there, and her heart went out toward the
lonely woman in a new rush of tenderness. Now that
she was released from the necessity of excusing her
mother&#8217;s faults&mdash;faults she could now ignore; now that
she could look upon her as a loyal friend, she was moved
to pity and to love, and, rising, she went to her and put
her arm about her neck, and said: &#8220;This won&#8217;t make
any difference. I am going to stay with you and help
you just the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tears came to the old woman&#8217;s eyes, and her voice
broke as she replied: &#8220;I knew you would say that, Lee
Virginia, but all the same I don&#8217;t intend to have you do
any such thing. You&#8217;ve got to cut loose from me altogether,
because some fine chap is going to come along
one of these days, and he won&#8217;t want me even as a <i>step</i>-mother-in-law.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
No, I have decided that you and me had
better live apart. I&#8217;ll get you a place to live up in Sulphur,
where I can visit you now and again; but I guess I am
elected to stay right here in the Fork. They don&#8217;t like
me, and I don&#8217;t like them; but I have kind o&#8217; got used to
their ways of looking at me sidewise; they don&#8217;t matter
as much as it would up there in the city.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee turned back wistfully toward the story of her
mother. &#8220;Where did my mother meet my father? Do
you know that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t. It was a runaway match, Ed said. I
never did know who her folks were&mdash;only I know they
thought she was marrying the wrong man.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl sighed as her mind took in the significance of
her mother&#8217;s coming to this wild country, leaving all that
she knew and loved behind. &#8220;Poor little mother. It
must have been very hard for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid she did have a hard time, for Ed admitted
to me that he hadn&#8217;t so much as a saddle when he landed
in the State. He hadn&#8217;t much when I met him first,
but everybody liked him. He was one of the handsomest
men that ever jumped a saddle. But he was close-mouthed.
You never could get anything out of him that
he didn&#8217;t want to tell, and I was never able to discover
what he had been doing in the southern part of the
State.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she pondered on her changed relationship to Lize,
Lee&#8217;s heart lightened. It <i>would</i> make a difference to
Ross. It would make a difference to the Redfields.
Traitorous as it seemed, it was a great relief&mdash;a joy&mdash;to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
know that her own mother, her real mother, had
been &#8220;nice.&#8221; &#8220;She <i>must</i> have been nice or Lize would
not have said so,&#8221; she reasoned, recalling that her stepmother
had admitted her feeling of jealousy.</p>
<p>At last Lize rose. &#8220;Well, now, dearie, I reckon we
had better turn in. It is getting chilly and late.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they were about to part at the door of the tent
Virginia took Lize&#8217;s face between her hands. &#8220;Good-night,
mother,&#8221; she said, and kissed her, to show her
that what she had said would not make any difference.</p>
<p>But Lize was not deceived. This unwonted caress
made perfectly plain to her the relief which filled the
girl&#8217;s heart.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Lee Virginia was awakened some hours later by a
roaring, crackling sound, and by the flare of a yellow
light upon her tent. Peering out, she saw flames shooting
up through the roof of the ranger&#8217;s cabin, while beside
it, wrapped in a blanket, calmly contemplating it, stood
Cavanagh with folded arms. A little nearer to the bridge
Redfield was sitting upon an upturned box.</p>
<p>With a cry of alarm she aroused her mother, and
Lize, heavy-eyed, laggard with sleep, rose slowly and
peered out at the scene with eyes of dull amazement.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t they try to put it out?&#8221; she demanded, as
she took in the import of the passive figures.</p>
<p>Dressing with tremulous haste, Lee stepped from the
tent just in time to see Swenson come from behind the
burning building and join the others in silent contemplation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
of the scene. There was something uncanny in the
calm inaction of the three strong men.</p>
<p>A dense fog hung low, enveloping the whole canon
in a moist, heavy, sulphurous veil, through which the
tongues of flame shot with a grandiose effect; but the
three foresters, whose shadows expanded, contracted, and
wavered grotesquely, remained motionless as carven figures
of ebony. It was as if they were contemplating
an absorbing drama, in whose enactment they had only
the spectator&#8217;s curious interest.</p>
<p>Slowly, wonderingly, the girl drew near and called to
Cavanagh, who turned quickly, crying out: &#8220;Don&#8217;t come
too close, and don&#8217;t be frightened. I set the place on
fire myself. The poor old herder died last night,
and is decently buried in the earth, and now we are
burning the cabin and every thread it contains to prevent
the spread of the plague. Hugh and Swenson have
divided their garments with me, and this blanket which
I wear is my only coat. All that I have is in that
cabin now going up in smoke&mdash;my guns, pictures, everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How could you do it?&#8221; she cried out, understanding
what his sacrifice had been.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;The Supervisor did it.
They had to go. The cabin was saturated with poison;
it had become to me a plague spot, and there was no
other way to stamp it out. I should never have felt
safe if I had carried out even so much as a letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dumb and shivering with the chill of the morning,
Lee Virginia drew nearer, ever nearer. &#8220;I am so sorry,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
she said, and yearned toward him, eager to comfort him,
but he warningly motioned her away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t come any nearer, for I dare not touch
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are not ill?&#8221; she cried out, with a note of
apprehension in her voice.</p>
<p>He smiled in response to her question. &#8220;No, I feel
nothing but weariness and a little depression. I can&#8217;t
help feeling somehow as if I were burning up a part of
myself in that fire&mdash;the saddle I have ridden for years,
my guns, ropes, spurs, everything relating to the forest,
are gone, and with them my youth. I have been something
of a careless freebooter myself, I fear; but that
is all over with now.&#8221; He looked her in the face with
a sad and resolute glance. &#8220;The Forest Service made
a man of me, taught me to regard the future. I never
accepted responsibility till I became a ranger, and in
thinking it all over I have decided to stay with it, as
the boys say, &#8216;till the spring rains.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very glad of that,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; Dalton thinks I can qualify for the position of
Supervisor, and Redfield may offer me the supervision
of this forest. If he does, I will accept it&mdash;if you will go
with me and share the small home which the Supervisor&#8217;s
pay provides. Will you go?&#8221;</p>
<p>In the light of his burning cabin, and in the shadow
of the great peaks, Lee Virginia could not fail of a certain
largeness and dignity of mood. She neither blushed nor
stammered, as she responded: &#8220;I will go anywhere in
the world with you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></p>
<p>He could not touch so much as the hem of her garment,
but his eyes embraced her, as he said: &#8220;God bless you
for the faith you seem to have in me!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Redfield&#8217;s voice interrupted with hearty clamor. &#8220;And
now, Miss Virginia, you go back and rustle some breakfast
for us all. Swenson, bring the horses in and harness
my team; I&#8217;m going to take these women down the
canon. And, Ross, you&#8217;d better saddle up as soon as you
feel rested and ride across the divide, and go into camp
in that little old cabin by the dam above my house.
You&#8217;ll have to be sequestered for a few days, I reckon,
till we see how you&#8217;re coming out. I&#8217;ll telephone over
to the Fork and have the place made ready for you,
and I&#8217;ll have the doctor go up there to meet you and put
you straight. If you&#8217;re going to be sick we&#8217;ll want you
where we can look after you. Isn&#8217;t that so, Lee Virginia?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed it is,&#8221; replied the girl, earnestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not going to be sick,&#8221; retorted Cavanagh.
&#8220;I refuse to be sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite right,&#8221; replied Redfield; &#8220;but all the same we
want you where we can get at you, and where medical
aid of the right sort is accessible. I&#8217;m going to fetch
my bed over here and put you into it. You need
rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee still lingered after Redfield left them. &#8220;Please
do as Mr. Redfield tells you,&#8221; she pleaded, &#8220;for I shall
be very anxious till you get safely down the mountains.
If that poor old man has any relatives they ought to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
told how kind you have been. You could not have been
kinder to one of your own people.&#8221;</p>
<p>These words from her had a poignancy of meaning
which made his reply difficult. His tone was designedly
light as he retorted: &#8220;I would be a fraud if I stood here
listening to your praise without saying&mdash;without confessing&mdash;how
deadly weary I got of the whole business.
It was simply that there was nothing else to do. I had
to go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her mind still dwelt on the tragic event. &#8220;I wish he
could have had some kind of a service. It seems sort
of barbarous to bury him without any one to say a prayer
over him. But I suppose that was impossible. Surely
some one ought to mark his grave, for some of his
people may come and want to know where he lies.&#8221;</p>
<p>He led her thoughts to pleasanter paths. &#8220;I am glad
you are going with the Supervisor. You <i>are</i> going, are
you not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, for a few days, till I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be tempted to pretend being sick just to keep you
near me,&#8221; he was saying, when Redfield returned, bringing
his sleeping-couch. Unrolling this under a tree beside
the creek, the Supervisor said: &#8220;Now, get into that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh resigned Lee with a smile. &#8220;Good-night,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Oh, but it&#8217;s good to remember that I shall
see you to-morrow!&#8221;</p>
<p>With a happy glance and a low &#8220;Good-bye&#8221; she turned
away.</p>
<p>Laying aside his blanket and his shoes, Cavanagh crept
into the snug little camp-bed. &#8220;Ah,&#8221; he breathed, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
a delicious sense of relief, &#8220;I feel as if I could sleep a
week!&#8221; And in an instant his eyes closed in slumber so
profound that it was barren even of dreams.</p>
<p>When he awoke it was noon, and Swenson, the guard,
was standing over him. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but it&#8217;s time to be
moving,&#8221; he said; &#8220;it&#8217;s a long ride over there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What time is it?&#8221; inquired Cavanagh, with some bewilderment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly noon. I&#8217;ve got some coffee ready. Want
some?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I? Just watch me!&#8221; And he scrambled out of
his bed with vigor, and stretched himself like a cat, exclaiming:
&#8220;Wow! but it does feel good to know that I am
out of jail!&#8221;</p>
<p>Going down to the stream, he splashed his face and
neck in the clear cold water, and the brisk rubbing which
followed seemed to clear his thought as well as sharpen
his appetite.</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem all right so far,&#8221; hazarded the guide.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am all right, and I&#8217;ll be all right to-morrow, if that&#8217;s
what you mean,&#8221; replied Cavanagh. &#8220;Well, now, pack
up, and we&#8217;ll pull out.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a few moments after he mounted his horse Cavanagh
looked about the place as if for the last time&mdash;now
up at the hill, now down at the meadow, and last of all
at the stream. &#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy this station as much
as I have, Swenson. It&#8217;s one of the prettiest on the whole
forest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Together they zigzagged up the side of the hill to the
north, and then with Cavanagh in the lead (followed by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
his pack-horse), they set up the long lateral moraine which
led by a wide circle through the wooded park toward the
pass. The weather was clear and cold. The wind bit,
and Cavanagh, scantily clothed as he was, drew his
robe close about his neck, saying: &#8220;I know now how it
feels to be a blanket Indian. I must say I prefer an
overcoat.&#8221;</p>
<p>A little later the keen eyes of the guard, sweeping the
mountain-side, were suddenly arrested. &#8220;There&#8217;s a
bunch of cowboys coming over the pass!&#8221; he called.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see them,&#8221; responded Cavanagh. &#8220;Get out your
glasses and tell me who they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Swenson unslung his field-glasses and studied the party
attentively. &#8220;Looks like Van Horne&#8217;s sorrel in the lead,
and that bald-face bay just behind looks like the one
Gregg rides. The other two I don&#8217;t seem to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s the sheriff after me for harboring
Edwards,&#8221; suggested Cavanagh.</p>
<p>But Swenson remained sober. He did not see the
humor of the remark. &#8220;What are they doing on the
forest, anyhow?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Half an hour later the two parties came face to face on
a little stretch of prairie in the midst of the wooded
valley. There were four in the sheriff&#8217;s party: Gregg,
the deputy, and a big man who was a stranger to Cavanagh.
Their horses were all tired, and the big civilian
looked saddle-weary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good evenin&#8217;, gentlemen!&#8221; called the sheriff, in
Southern fashion, as he drew near.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good evenin&#8217;, Mr. Sheriff,&#8221; Cavanagh civilly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
answered. &#8220;What&#8217;s the meaning of this invasion of my
forest?&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheriff, for answer, presented the big stranger.
&#8220;Mr. Cavanagh, this is Mr. Simpson, the county attorney.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh nodded to the attorney. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of Mr.
Simpson,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Simpson answered the question Ross had asked. &#8220;We
were on our way to your station, Mr. Cavanagh, because
we understand that this old man Dunn who shot himself
had visited you before his death, giving you information
concerning the killing of the Mexican sheep-herders.
Is that true?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When did he visit you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two days ago, or maybe three. I am a little mixed
about it. You see, I have been pretty closely confined
to my shack for a few days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gregg threw in a query. &#8220;How <i>is</i> the old man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s all right; that is to say, he&#8217;s dead. Died
last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheriff looked at Simpson meaningly. &#8220;Well,
I reckon that settles his score, judge. Even if he was
implicated, he&#8217;s out of it now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He couldn&#8217;t have been implicated,&#8221; declared the
ranger, &#8220;for he was with me at the time the murder was
committed. I left him high on the mountain in the
Basque herder&#8217;s camp. I can prove an alibi for him.
Furthermore, he had no motive for such work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did Dunn tell you?&#8221; demanded the sheriff.
&#8220;What names did he give you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; replied Cavanagh, who felt himself
to be on his own territory, and not to be hurried.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a reward offered for the arrest of these men, is
there not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is,&#8221; replied the attorney.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, before I make my statement I&#8217;d like to request
that my share of the reward, if there is any coming to
me, shall be paid over to the widow of the man who gave
me the information. Poor chap, he sacrificed himself
for the good of the State, and his family should be spared
all the suffering possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite right, Mr. Cavanagh. You may consider that
request granted. Now for the facts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Before going into that, Mr. Attorney, I&#8217;d like to speak
to you alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, sir,&#8221; replied the attorney. Then waving
his hand toward the others, he said: &#8220;Boys, just ride off a
little piece, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>When they were alone, Cavanagh remarked: &#8220;I don&#8217;t
think it wise to give these names to the wind, for if we
do, there will be more fugitives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see your point,&#8221; Simpson agreed.</p>
<p>Thereupon, rapidly and concisely, the ranger reported
what Dunn had said, and the attorney listened thoughtfully
without speaking to the end; then he added: &#8220;That
tallies with what we have got from Ballard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was Ballard in it?&#8221; asked Cavanagh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we forced a confession from him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he was in it, it was merely for the pay. He represented
some one else.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because he was crazy to return to the show with
which he used to perform, and desperately in need of
money. Have you thought that Gregg might have had
a hand in this affair? Dunn said he had, although he
was not present at any of the meetings.&#8221;</p>
<p>This seemed to surprise the attorney very much. &#8220;But
he&#8217;s a sheepman!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know he is; but he&#8217;s also a silent partner in the
Triangle cattle outfit, and is making us a lot of trouble.
And, besides, he had it in for these dagoes, as he calls
them, because they were sheeping territory which he
wanted himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s any too good for it,&#8221; responded
Simpson, &#8220;but I doubt if he had any hand in the killing;
he&#8217;s too cunning and too cowardly. But I&#8217;ll keep in mind
what you have said, and if he is involved in any degree,
he&#8217;ll have to go down the road with the others&mdash;his money
can&#8217;t save him.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they came back to the party Cavanagh thought he
detected in Gregg&#8217;s eyes a shifting light that was not there
before, but he made no further attempt to impress his
opinion upon the attorney or the sheriff. He only said:
&#8220;Well, now, gentlemen, I must go on over the divide.
I have an appointment with the doctor over there; also
with a bed and a warmer suit of clothes than I have on.
If I can be of any service to you when I am out of quarantine,
I hope you will call upon me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is possible that we may need you in order to locate
some of the men whose names you have given me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; replied Cavanagh. &#8220;If they come upon
the forest anywhere, the Supervisor and I will find them
for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they parted, and Cavanagh and his guard resumed
their slow journey across the range.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
</div>

<p>In her career as the wife of a Western rancher, Eleanor
Redfield had been called upon to entertain many strange
guests, and she made no very determined objection when
her husband telephoned that he was bringing Lize as well
as Lee Virginia to stay at Elk Lodge for a few days. The
revelation of the true relation between the two women
had (as Lize put it) made a &#8220;whole lot of difference&#8221; to
Mrs. Redfield. It naturally cleared the daughter of some
part of her handicap, and it had also made the mother&#8217;s
attitude less objectionable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the loyalty of Eliza to Ross, her bravery
in defending him from attack, and the love and
courage which enabled her to rise from a sick-bed and go
to the mountains, ready and insistent on taking his place
as nurse&mdash;all these were not the traits of a commonplace
personality. &#8220;I begin to think I&#8217;ve been unjust to Mrs.
Wetherford,&#8221; she admitted to her husband.</p>
<p>She had seen Lize but once, and that was in the distorting
atmosphere of the restaurant, and she remembered
her only as a lumpy, scowling, loud-voiced creature
with blowsy hair and a watchful eye. She was profoundly
surprised, therefore, when Lee Virginia introduced a
quiet-spoken, rather sad-faced elderly woman as her
mother.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you, Mrs. Wetherford,&#8221; Eleanor said,
with the courtesy which was instinctive with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m mightily obliged for the chance to come,&#8221; replied
Lize. &#8220;I told Reddy&mdash;I mean the Supervisor&mdash;that you
didn&#8217;t want no old-timer like me, but he said &#8216;Come
along,&#8217; and Lee she fixed me out, and here I am.&#8221; She
uttered this with a touch of her well-known self-depreciation,
but she was by no interpretation sordid or
common.</p>
<p>She did, indeed, show Lee&#8217;s care, and her manner, while
manifestly formed upon Lee&#8217;s instructions, was never
ludicrous. She was frankly curious about the house and
its pretty things, and swore softly in her surprise and
pleasure. &#8220;Think of an old cow-boss like me living up
to these jimmy-cracks!&#8221; As they went to their room together,
she made a confession: &#8220;The thing that scares
me worst is <i>eating</i>. I&#8217;ve et at the Alma times enough,
but to handle a fork here with El&#8217;nor Redfield lookin&#8217; on!
Great peter! ain&#8217;t there some way of takin&#8217; my meals out
in the barn? I wouldn&#8217;t mind you and Ross and Reddy&mdash;it&#8217;s
the missis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross had not yet arrived at the cabin, but Redfield had
warned Lee not to expect him till after dark. &#8220;He
probably slept late, and, besides, there are always delays
on the trail. But don&#8217;t worry. Swenson will ride to the
top of the divide with him, and if it seems necessary will
come all the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>This feeling of anxiety helped to steady Lize, and she
got through the meal very well. She was unwontedly
silent, and a little sad as well as constrained. She could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
see that Lee fitted in with these surroundings, that she
was at home with shining silver and dainty dishes, and
she said to herself: &#8220;I could have been something like
her if I&#8217;d had any sort o&#8217; raisin&#8217;, but it&#8217;s too late now.
But oh, Lord! wouldn&#8217;t Ed like to see her now!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not yet dark when they came out on the veranda
to meet the doctor, who had come to meet Ross, and
Lee&#8217;s anxiety led her to say: &#8220;Can&#8217;t we go up to the cabin
and wait for him there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was about to propose that,&#8221; replied Redfield.
&#8220;Shall we walk?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee was instant in her desire to be off, but Lize said:
&#8220;I never was much on foot and now I&#8217;m hoof-bound.
You go along, and I&#8217;ll sit on the porch here and watch.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Lee, the doctor, and Redfield went off together
across the meadow toward the little cabin which had
been built for the workmen while putting in the dam.
It was hardly a mile away, and yet it stood at the mouth
of a mighty gorge, out of which the water sprang white
with speed.</p>
<p>But Lee had no mind for the scenery, though her eyes
were lifted to the meadow&#8217;s wall, down which the ranger
was expected to ride. It looked frightfully steep, and
whenever she thought of him descending that trail, worn
and perhaps ill, her heart ached with anxiety. But
Redfield rambled on comfortably, explaining the situation
to the doctor, who, being a most unimaginative
person, appeared to take it all as a matter of course.</p>
<p>At the cabin itself Lee transferred her interest to the
supper which had been prepared for the ranger, and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
went about the room trying to make it a little more comfortable
for him. It was a bare little place, hardly more
than a camp (as was proper), and she devoutly prayed
that he was not to be sick therein, for it stood in a cold and
gloomy place, close under the shadow of a great wall of
rock.</p>
<p>As it grew dark she lighted a lamp and placed it outside
the window in order that its light might catch the ranger&#8217;s
eye, and this indeed it did, for almost instantly a pistol-shot
echoed from the hillside, far above, signalling his
approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;There he is!&#8221; she exclaimed, in swift rebound to
ecstasy. &#8220;Hear him shout?&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice could indeed be heard, though faintly, and
so they waited while the darkness deepened and the voice
of the stream rose like an exhalation, increasing in
violence as the night fell.</p>
<p>At last they could hear the sound of his horse&#8217;s feet
upon the rocks, and with girlish impulse Lee raised a
musical cry&mdash;an invitation as well as a joyous signal.</p>
<p>To this the ranger made vocal answer, and they could
soon see him moving athwart the hillsides, zigzagging in
the trailer&#8217;s fashion, dropping down with incredible
swiftness. He was alone, and leading his horse, but his
celerity of movement and the tones of his voice denoted
confidence and health.</p>
<p>The doctor laughed as he said: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think a very
sick man could come down a mountain like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he isn&#8217;t sick yet,&#8221; said Redfield. &#8220;What we are
afraid of is a possible development.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></p>
<p>The ranger, as he came rushing down the final slope,
found his knees weakened as much by excitement as by
weariness. To hear Lee&#8217;s clear voice down there, to
know that she was waiting for him, was to feel himself the
luckiest of men. Escaping contagion and being on his
way to a larger position were as nothing compared to the
lure of that girlish halloo. He saw the lamp shine afar,
but he could not distinguish the girl&#8217;s form till he
emerged from the clump of pine-trees which hid the
bottom of the trail. Then they all shouted together, and
Redfield, turning to Lee, warningly said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, my dear girl, you and I must not interfere with
the doctor. We will start back to the house at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet&mdash;not till we&#8217;ve seen him and talked with
him,&#8221; she pleaded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a particle of danger,&#8221; said the
doctor, &#8220;but perhaps you&#8217;d better not wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cavanagh came up with shining eyes and heavy breath.
&#8220;I made it&mdash;but oh, I&#8217;m tired! I never was tired like
this before in my life.&#8221; He looked at her as he spoke.
&#8220;But I&#8217;m feeling fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Doctor French, Ross.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you doctor? I&#8217;m not shaking hands these
days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well see about that,&#8221; replied the physician.</p>
<p>&#8220;I met the sheriff on the way, Mr. Supervisor, and I gave
him the story Dunn told me, and I made a request that
the reward for the information be paid to Dunn&#8217;s widow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see to that,&#8221; responded Redfield. &#8220;And now
we&#8217;ll leave you to the tender mercies of the doctor.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I made some coffee for you, and you&#8217;ll find some
supper under a napkin on the table,&#8221; explained Lee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry it isn&#8217;t better. It&#8217;s only cold chicken and
sandwiches&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only cold chicken!&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;My chief anxiety
is lest it should not prove a whole chicken. I&#8217;m hungry
as a coyote!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, good-night,&#8221; said Redfield. &#8220;Doctor,
you&#8217;ll report as you go by?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; expect me in half an hour or so.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so Lee walked away with Redfield, almost entirely
relieved of her care. &#8220;He can&#8217;t be ill, can he?&#8221;
she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how he can. His life has made him as
clean and strong as an oak-tree on a windy slope. He is
all right, and very happy. Your being there to meet
him was very sweet to him, I could see that. If it should
turn out that you should be the one to keep him here and
in the Forest Service I shall be very grateful to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not reply to this, but walked along in silence
by his side, feeling very small, very humble, but very
content.</p>
<p>Lize was on the veranda. &#8220;Did he get through?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s all right so far,&#8221; returned Redfield, cheerily.
&#8220;We left the doctor about to fly at him. We&#8217;ll have a
report soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had hardly finished telling of how the ranger
had descended the hill when the doctor arrived. &#8220;He
hasn&#8217;t a trace of it,&#8221; was his report. &#8220;All he needs is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
sleep. I cut him off from his entire over-the-range outfit,
and there&#8217;s no reason why he should not come down to
breakfast with you in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Redfield thanked the doctor as fervently as if he
had conferred a personal favor upon her, and the girl
echoed her grateful words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; the doctor replied, in true
Western fashion; &#8220;I&#8217;ll do as much more for you any
time.&#8221; And he rode away, leaving at least one person
too happy to sleep.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The same person was on the veranda next morning
when Cavanagh, dressed in the Supervisor&#8217;s best suit of
gray cassimere, came striding across the lawn&mdash;too impatient
of the winding drive to follow it. As he came,
his face glowing with recovered health, Lee thought
him the god of the morning, and went to meet him
unashamed, and he took her to his arms and kissed her
quite as he had promised himself to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I <i>know</i> that I am delivered!&#8221; he exclaimed,
and together they entered upon the building of a home
in the New West.</p>
